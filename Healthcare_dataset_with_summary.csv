kYLE jAcKsoN,13,F,B-,Asthma,24-05-2020,Barbara Parsons,Small-Shaw,Cigna,31988.67367,156,Emergency,15-06-2020,Paracetamol,Abnormal,"After a multidisciplinary evaluation, at the end of November 2019, a 13-year-old girl attended the Pain Therapy Clinic of the Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesù in Rome, where acupuncture is also practiced as an analgesic technique. She reported pain in the left wrist and hand, with intensity 10 on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NRS), pulsating, and always present, thus preventing any movement. Marked hypersensitivity and allodynia were present at the level of the left fingers, wrist and hand. Pain was present in both flexion and extension of the wrist and caused a marked reduction in strength in the left wrist and hand, making a handshake impossible for the girl. There was no redness but swelling and sweating at the level of the fingers of the left hand. The pain was so intense that it interfered with her regular attendance at school, generating social withdrawal phenomena, which are unfortunately very frequent in patients with chronic pain.\nPain began three months before the consultation, after an accidental fall with trauma to the left wrist. It gradually increased and did not respond to either NSAIDs or limb immobilization. The diagnostic tests performed at the time (X-ray, Doppler ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging) were negative, as were the blood chemistry tests ( and ).\nFrom the age of 8, the girl was followed by a pediatrician in our hospital for a history of cramps and pain in the lower limbs, especially in the ankle and left knee, both in the absence of trauma or caused by frequent falls. In the following years, clinicians found bilateral flatfoot (with subsequent surgery), mild ligamentous hyperlaxity and vitamin D deficiency. In addition, borderline cognitive level with motor coordination disorder and executive function deficit, as well as stuttering, were then diagnosed. Elements of anxiety emerged from the administration of Self Administered Psychiatric Scales for Children and Adolescents (SAFA-A, D and S) questionnaires, as highlighted in particular by the subscales “Separation anxiety” and “Generalized anxiety” [,]. Concern for one’s own health was observed, with experiences of herself as being ill; the scores indicate a propensity to somatize. There was a tone of mood oriented in a deflected sense, and insecurity. The results of the Lie scale were: 8; T: 65 [,]. In addition to pulsating headache with phono and photophobia, frontal epilepsy was also diagnosed, which could explain the frequent falls, and moreover had excluded hyperbaric oxygen therapy as a feasible regimen in this case (due to a cost/benefit evaluation, and increased exposure to oxygen toxicity during the treatment itself). Episodes of dizziness with difficulty in maintaining an upright position lasting a few hours were also observed, and on two occasions she also had an episode of unconsciousness lasting about 2 min.\nDuring the first visit, as a consequence of the mother’s need to have time to convince the recalcitrant daughter, in the meantime it was recommended to administer oral tramadol (100 mg/mL), 5 gtt in the morning and 5 gtt in order to reduce musculoskeletal pain. The reason for choosing a drug such as tramadol rather than any other pharmacological option lies in the fact that the pain was so intense that it affected the patient’s relationships []. We therefore opted for a drug that would have an immediate effect, so as to be able to undertake the acupuncture course. Subsequently, in the first two sessions, after careful disinfection of the skin with 2% chlorhexidine, and using the appropriate needles for length and diameter based on the type of acupuncture and the selected points, we used the following acupoints: TE 4 (Yang Pool), TE 5 (Waiguan), LI 5 (Yang Xi) and SI 4 (Wan Gu), all on the left side. These points were chosen on the basis of a pathology which, according to traditional Chinese medicine, was caused by cold wind. These points produced heat and dissipated the wind []. The needles were kept for 30′, with stimulation every 10′. In the third session, the girl reported a slight improvement in the painful symptoms but at the same time unbearable pain in the affected limb during the previous sessions due to the insertion and maintenance of the needles in the affected area. We decided to change strategy and to use abdominal acupuncture and stimulation of the points CV 4 (Guan Yuan), CV 12 (Zhong Wan), CV 16 (Zhong Ting), CV 17 (Shan Zong), ST 24 bilateral (Huaroumen) and KI 17 bilateral (Shang Qu), with appropriate needles and maintaining the same interspeed and time of stimulation. The needles were inserted to a depth of 0.2 cun. These new points (CV 4, CV 12, CV 16, CV 17 and KI 17), in addition to heating and dissipating the wind, re-established the correct circulation of qi []. In fact, used in combination, their purpose was to move the qi from the kidney to the extremity of the upper limb passing through the shoulder [,]. ST 24 was used to calm the patient and increase her compliance with acupuncture [].\nAuriculotherapy was also associated with Vaccaria seeds on the Wrist, Hand and Shenmen points, with the recommendation to stimulate them at home for 10 min, 4 times a day until the next session. Vaccaria seeds are used to stimulate certain points in auriculotherapy due to their almost spherical shape, and the absence of pharmacological properties []. The Shenmen point was chosen for its anxiolytic effect, given the patient’s psychological difficulties [].\nAfter eight sessions (two months) of abdominal acupuncture the pain completely disappeared (Numeric Pain Rating Scale value 0) and the girl regained full functional capacity of the arm and a normal life. Follow-up at three months, six months and one year demonstrated complete remission of symptoms, with constant values of NRS equal to 0. The reduction in pain, and subsequently its total disappearance, allowed the patient to resume normal school attendance, and therefore to resume a life of normal, balanced relationships.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JeNnIFer JoHNsoN,13,F,AB+,Arthritis,03-05-2020,Denise Mayo,"Banks Gordon and Browning,",Medicare,30506.93572,459,Emergency,29-05-2020,Aspirin,Abnormal,"Our patient was a 13-year-old Caucasian female with a history of anxiety, depression, and anorexia nervosa. She was admitted twice to our hospital. The first admission was in September 2019, when her parents brought her for losing 16 kg over 3–4 months. She was weighing 40 kg (BMI 16.0 kg/m2, 8.7%ile, z = − 1.4) and had sinus bradycardia (HR 30–40 BPM). Table and Fig. show changes in her lab values during her two admissions.\nThe patient reported sadness, loneliness, anhedonia, and hopelessness and admitted to restrictive eating behaviors to lose weight. There was no history of purging, bingeing or laxative use. Although emaciated, she minimized the severity of her nutritional status or her preoccupation with her weight and body image. She denied suicidal ideation but desired death rather than pursuing an eating disorder treatment. The patient had compulsive tendencies for academic work and extracurricular pursuits and was highly driven. She had several moves during childhood and reported increased anxiety after a recent move to live with her father following parental divorce. She was starting a new school, as well. We placed her on 1:1 for safety concerns.\nThe patient started restricting around the age of ten after having a growth spurt at puberty. Following her diagnosis of AN, she received eating disorder treatment at different levels of care, including inpatient, residential, partial hospitalization or Day Program, and intensive outpatient programs in four states. She would become physically aggressive towards staff and family to sabotage her recovery. In one incident, she bit a chunk off the nape of her sister’s neck during a family visit in her residential stay, leading her to be discharged. She admitted to becoming jealous of the sister as she was to go home after the visit while the patient was to remain confined to the unit. She had no remorse about the incident. There was a report where she left the gas stove on to burn the house and kill her mom and her siblings when she was angry. She again had no regrets about her actions. She had history of hurting the family cat. This history of repeated aggression over several years toward other people and animals indicated a possible CD diagnosis. Family history was pertinent for anxiety and mood disorders and AN.\nDuring admission, she hid meals, avoided cardiopulmonary monitoring, and refused nasogastric tube. She would engage in isometric exercises and avoid lying down. She did not take medication for anxiety. As she failed weight restoration in the medical hospital, we referred her to an out-of-state inpatient eating disorder unit for further treatment. Right before the transfer, she jeopardized the transfer by stabbing her pediatrician with a pair of scissors that she hid from the Child Life Services supplies in her room. She intended to hurt the physician for transferring her to the inpatient unit. A room search discovered multiple sharp objects under her mattress, including plastic knives, forks, and medical supplies. For ongoing aggression, she necessitated physical restraints and emergency use of Lorazepam. The patient was formally diagnosed with CD after this incident.\nThe inpatient eating disorder facility refused to accept the patient after the violence, which led our interdisciplinary team to plan her weight restoration by implementing behavioral expectations and positive reinforcement techniques for meeting daily nutritional needs. Some of the privileges were using the phone, watching TV, or playing video games. We initiated and titrated chlorpromazine 50 mg twice daily for aggression. She gained 2.7 kg in about 6 weeks and her bradycardia resolved (see Fig. ). Her T3 and prealbumin normalized (see Table ). After 24 days in the hospital, she was discharged with a plan to start an eating disorder partial hospitalization program.\nFollowing discharge, she participated in the partial hospitalization program for 5 days. On the morning of the sixth day, she entered her father’s bedroom and stabbed him three times with a butcher’s knife. She had purchased the knife the day before to kill her father, blaming him for the eating disorder treatment. She was arrested and remanded to Juvenile Justice Center (JJC), where she started refusing to eat or to take chlorpromazine. She rapidly lost weight and was readmitted for her second admission to our pediatric hospital. On readmission, she weighed 36.5 kg (BMI 14.6 kg/m2, z = − 2.3, 1.0%ile) and was bradycardic and mildly hypothermic with a reduction in T3 and prealbumin. An echocardiogram demonstrated a trace posterior pericardial effusion with normal cardiac function. She was handcuffed and ankle-cuffed to her bed throughout her stay. We switched chlorpromazine to olanzapine (3.5 mg in divided doses), and added fluoxetine (10 mg daily) to address anxiety. She used Lorazepam for anxiety during feedings via NG tube initially. After gaining about 8 kg in about 6 weeks (see Fig. ), she was discharged back to the JJC, where she continued receiving eating disorder treatment. We suspected that some of the weight gain was related to rehydration. Her pericardial effusion resolved ultimately.\nWe observed a shift in her statements during weight restoration. For example, “I don’t see how a boy could like me now that I have gained weight” changed to “it does bother me to gain weight, but I try and focus on getting my period back, which makes it easier.” The JJC’s focus on positive reinforcement and reward systems seemingly motivated her to earn additional privileges for desired behaviors. She proudly shared when gaining access to the commissary at JJC, an upgrade in her shoes, a later bedtime, and her ability to spend time with peers in the gym under supervision to prevent over-exercise. JJC staff, many of whom chaperoned her during hospitalization, learned positive reinforcement and practical techniques taught to parents in family-based treatment (FBT) programs and implemented those strategies while she remained incarcerated. Her desire of “never to be hospitalized again” served as a motivation to completing her meals. She had regular follow up with our adolescent medicine team to monitor her progress. As she continued to gain weight, and her anxiety and aggressive impulses decreased. After one visit with our psychiatry team 4 weeks after her discharge, JJC’s psychiatrist took over her psychiatric care and titrated olanzapine to 7.5 mg twice daily and fluoxetine 20 mg daily. Her olanzapine was subsequently decreased to 5 mg twice daily for mild elevation in transaminases that later resolved. Six months after discharge from the hospital, she was still in custody at the JJC, and her nutritional status remained stable. Her menses returned. After complaining of weight gain as an adverse effect of psychotropics, she discontinued olanzapine and later on fluoxetine. However, she maintained her body weight after stopping the medications (see Fig. ). She has remained in outpatient treatment; and we anticipate that this will be needed long-term given the severity of her symptoms of CD and AN.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Her chief complaint was the crowding of her anterior teeth. Her medical and dental histories were noncontributory, and the patient did not mention any previous or recent habit. On physical examination, no swelling or tenderness was documented.\nUpon clinical examination, the patient had all her permanent teeth and a retained mandibular left second primary molar. Radiographic records consisted of an orthopantomogram, a lateral cephalogram, a posteroanterior cephalogram, and a hand wrist radiograph. The orthopantomogram revealed a well-defined radiolucent lesion on the mandibular left side surrounding the unerupted mandibular left second premolar which appeared to be mesially tipped below the retained primary second molar. The root of the adjacent premolar was included in the lesion but did not reveal any root resorption (Figures and ).\nGoing back to the old orthopantomogram (OPG) of the patient collected by the Pediatrics Department, it was noted that no lesion was visible at that time (). The patient was referred to the Oral Pathology Department in order to obtain a meticulous diagnosis concerning the radiolucent lesion that was detected on the orthopantomogram during the initial diagnosis. The differential diagnosis for the lesion included a DC, an odontogenic keratocyst, and an ameloblastoma. Histologically, a thick epithelial lining with rete ridges was present. Moreover, chronic inflammatory cellular infiltration appeared in the capsule of the cyst. All these findings confirmed that the diagnosed cyst is a DC. The major objective of initiating the treatment as early as possible in this patient was to hinder the progression of the DC prohibiting its destructive consequences. Moreover, the aim of initiating a nonaggressive (marsupialization) treatment was to save the involved tooth, allowing its healthy eruption.\nSeveral treatment modalities of a DC have been reported in the literature ranging from marsupialization to enucleation. The common treatment for DC is enucleation followed by extraction of the involved tooth. When the cyst is large, the first approach is marsupialization to decrease the size of the osseous defect and then enucleation and tooth extraction are performed afterwards [–].\nEnucleation is the chosen treatment plan whenever the cyst is small and saving the involved tooth is impossible. This treatment modality should be avoided in large cysts since it is usually accompanied by facial, esthetic, and functional defects [].\nOther approaches are considered when the cyst is small and when the patient is young. In cases of enlarged follicles of impacted canines, exposing the affected tooth surgically and the traction of the tooth by orthodontic means leads to the cessation of the cystic lesion and the preservation of the affected tooth [].\nTaking into consideration that the diagnosed cyst can potentially become an aggressive lesion with a bone destructive ability that might lead to loss of the involved teeth, root resorption, pain, and facial asymmetry, and considering the age of the patient, a primary approach by marsupialization was initiated ().\nAfter the surgery, the patient was instructed to wear the acrylic resin obturator that was previously fabricated to maintain the surgical opening during healing and assure success of the surgery (). The patient was asked to eat with the obturator in place and remove it only for cleaning. Follow-up appointments were scheduled every three months postsurgery to assure the eruption of the second premolar and the absence of any recurrence.\nThe postsurgical orthopantomogram (OPG) that was taken 6 months after the surgery revealed the absence of any radiolucent lesion and the successful eruption of the mandibular left second premolar (Figures and ).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She had admitted to suicidal ideation and overdose, but was unable to disclose the time of ingestion or exposure. Family suspected that she had ingested clonidine and methylphenidate, thought to be the only medications accessible at home. She was otherwise healthy and had no prescribed medications. She had no known drug allergies and did not use alcohol, or any illicit substances.\nOn arrival to the nursing station, she was lethargic but rousable and followed commands. Her vital signs were stable, and she had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 10. There was no evidence of meningismus or focal neurological deficits, and both cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations were unremarkable.\nDue to resource limitations, initial investigations were limited to point of care testing which included venous blood gas, electrolytes, glucose, creatinine, complete blood count and INR (international normalized ratio) (see Table ). Results were notable for an elevated creatinine (2.32 mg/dL), elevated INR (5.0) and low serum bicarbonate (17 mmol/L). Alcohol, acetaminophen, salicylate level and chemistries including transaminase levels and lactate were not available.\nTwo hours after her arrival, the nurses requested a transfer to the closest acute care hospital which was 2600 km away. While awaiting the transport team, she deteriorated clinically, becoming hypotensive (blood pressure 85/50) and neurologically unresponsive. Repeat neurologic assessment at 24 h after arrival had significantly worsened revealing nonreactive, dilated (6 mm) pupils and decerebrate posturing to pain. Available point-of-care laboratory testing was repeated (Table ) revealing an INR was 5.4. An advanced care transport team (physician and respiratory therapist) arrived 28 h after presentation to the nursing station. Upon their arrival, they established an advanced airway and given the concern for increased intracranial pressure (ICP) based on the clinical picture, mannitol (500 mg/kg), phenytoin and ceftriaxone were administered. She received empiric treatment with vitamin K 10 mg IV (intravenous) for the elevated INR.\nIn discussions with the regional poison centre, the elevated INR and creatinine following overdose were suspicious for unrecognized acetaminophen toxicity. Aproximately 28 h after the patient’s initial presentation, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was started empirically at a 140 mg/kg IV loading dose and continued at 70 mg/kg IV every 4 h.\nThe patient arrived at the pediatric tertiary care hospital 38 h after her initial presentation. Her neurologic examination revealed a GCS of 3 with pupils fixed and dilated 5 mm bilaterally, as well as intermittent posturing. Cough and gag reflexes were present. Laboratory investigations (Table ) corroborated the suspected diagnosis of acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure. A CT (computed tomography) brain scan showed diffuse edema with effacement of sulci and basal cisterns, and uncal herniation (Fig. ). Given these findings, she was transferred to a pediatric quaternary care center for evaluation for liver transplantation where she was assessed by neurology, neurosurgery and the liver transplant team. At 60 h post-initial presentation, her neurologic exam demonstrated fixed, dilated and non-reactive pupils, with flaccid tone in the upper extremities and increased tone in lower extremities, but without spasticity or clonus. She had a negative vestibulo-ocular reflex (no eye movement with “doll’s eyes” maneuver), absent gag and cough reflexes, but intact corneal reflexes. An EEG (electroencephalogram) showed continuous generalized slowing consistent with severe metabolic encephalopathy. Additional investigations to rule out alternative etiologies for acute liver failure included viral serologies, autoimmune and metabolic markers, and liver ultrasound, none of which revealed an alternative diagnosis. Given her poor neurologic prognosis, she was deemed ineligible for liver transplant and the withdrawal of life sustaining therapies was recommended.\nThe family agreed and requested that other family members be present prior to removal of life-sustaining therapy. Given the family’s request to wait a few days until others could arrive, she remained on full ventilatory support and continued to receive intensive care treatments, including NAC 70 mg/kg IV every 4 h until day 5, mannitol for neuroprotection (500 mg/kg IV), vitamin K (10 mg IV) and fresh frozen plasma (10 ml/kg) for coagulopathy. On day 4 her transaminases stabilized, and synthetic liver function studies improved. On Day 6, she spontaneously opened her eyes and lifted her fingers. She made continued neurologic improvements and 8 days post admission she was purposefully moving all extremities. With her remarkable clinical improvement, the care plan was changed from withdrawal of life sustaining treatments to full medical treatment. She was successfully extubated on day 11 following initial presentation and later continued recovery on the pediatric inpatient ward. She was discharged home 34 days following her initial presentation with a near complete neurologic recovery, save for a right third and sixth cranial nerve palsy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient denied any recent fevers, and no rash was reported. Review of systems was notable for the left ear drainage. Immunization status was unknown, and she was not reported to have been previously treated for any significant illness, though the history was limited by the patient's custodial circumstances. She lived in a small house in rural North Carolina with 21 other Marshallese immigrants and was cared for by relatives who had assumed care for her at the time of her immigration five years before.\nExamination during the initial hospital visit revealed dehydration and acute otitis media with rupture of the tympanic membrane. Laboratory results revealed leukocytosis, prerenal azotemia, elevated liver enzymes, and mildly elevated lipase (). Computed tomography (CT) showed scattered focal pulmonary infiltrates, splenomegaly, and a markedly distended stomach without an obvious focus of mechanical obstruction (). Cytomegalovirus and Epstein–Barr virus serology were requested with results suggesting prior exposure. She was admitted with a presumptive diagnosis of gastroparesis secondary to a nonspecific viral infection and possible mild pancreatitis. An NG tube was placed resulting in high volume output. Her symptoms gradually improved over several days with IV fluid support and bowel rest; her NG was successfully removed, and she was discharged home tolerating a regular diet.\nTwo days after discharge, the patient returned with recurrence of her prior symptoms. The patient appeared acutely ill with dehydration. On lung exam, scattered crackles were noted. She was also noted to have diffuse small nodular lesions most apparent on her hands, feet, lower legs, and face (). An advocate placed with the family reported her concern for additional symptoms of chronic weight loss and productive cough with posttussive emesis and reported the skin changes to have been present for months. Prior exposure to or testing for tuberculosis was unknown. The patient did not report symptoms of peripheral neuropathy.\nLaboratory results revealed a relatively increased white blood cell count (21.4 × 109 per liter) with significant worsening of her renal function (creatinine of 2.45 mg/dL which had previously been normalized with rehydration) and persistent mild elevation in liver enzymes and lipase. Respiratory viral screening was positive for rhino/enterovirus. Repeat CT imaging showed persistent gastric dilation and splenomegaly ().\nThe patient was placed on empiric antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia and put on reverse isolation with concern for tuberculosis. Skin biopsies of multiple lesions were obtained and sent for pathology and culture (). Because multiple attempts to place an NG tube failed and vomiting failed to respond to conservative measures, endogastroduodenoscopy was pursued. The scope passed into the stomach and through the pylorus easily, reaching a normal-appearing proximal duodenum. However, a feeding tube could not be passed beyond the pylorus and was left just proximal to the pylorus for decompression. Stomach mucosa was described as having a “cobblestone” appearance in places, with one area of ulceration possibly due to prior nasogastric tube. Stomach biopsies revealed Helicobacter pylori and chronic active gastritis, but were negative for AFB.\nDue to persistent evidence of gastric outlet obstruction, an upper gastrointestinal study was performed which suggested gastric volvulus. The patient proceeded to gastropexy via open gastrostomy tube placement. The surgeons reported an extremely large and patulous stomach that had twisted mesenteroaxially. Gastric aspirates were negative for AFB.\nBiopsies of the skin lesions confirmed the presence of many AFB with changes consistent with lepromatous leprosy due to M. leprae (). Additionally, the serial sputum samples were positive for AFB, and culture of the skin sample for AFB showed evidence of growth within a few days, suggesting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) pulmonary infection and possibly disseminated MTB given selectivity of the culture medium.\nIn coordination with the health department and the infectious disease service, the patient was initiated on treatment for presumed disseminated MTB, noting that this would also provide coverage for M. leprae. However, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing from the sputum samples and skin samples failed to demonstrate MTB, while PCR testing performed at the Hansen's Disease Center of skin samples was positive for M. leprae. Retrospectively, it was felt that growth detected on the AFB culture was due to metabolism by an unusually large inoculum.\nGradually, the patient's oral intake improved. With hydration, her renal function again returned to normal. After several weeks of inpatient treatment, the patient discharged to complete therapy through the health department. Symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction have not returned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain and spinal cord revealed left cerebellar expansive lesion with no evidence of metastasis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed no evidence of dissemination. He underwent complete surgical resection as confirmed by postoperative imaging. Histopathological analysis including reticulin staining revealed a desmoplastic/nodular MB (confirmed by a central review by T.P.) as shown in Figure . Diffuse severe cytological anaplasia was not present. Complementary immunophenotypic characterization as described (, ) suggested a MB with SHH activation, TP53 wild-type (Figure ). Of note, nuclear INI-1 staining was preserved (Figure ) while P53 immunostaining showed nuclear positivity only in a small proportion of the tumor cells (data not shown). There was no evidence of MYCN or MYCC amplification by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). Next generation sequencing (NGS) over a panel of 50 genes (Ion AmpliSeq™ Cancer Hotspot Panel v2) revealed IDH1 R132C mutation in 46% of cells. NGS was repeated over a panel of 400 genes (Ion AmpliSeq™ Comprehensive Cancer Panel)1 and it revealed IDH1 R132C mutation in 24% of cells as well as SMARCB1-R201G in 30% of cells and CDH11-L625T in 26% of cells (Table A1). The panel was tested on both tumor and normal tissue to confirm the somatic nature of the mutations. Of note, mutations in SMO, PTCH1, SUFU and TP53 were not detected. Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip (850k) array revealed highest resemblance to the methylation class MB, subclass SHH A (children and adult). However, the calibrated score was 0.44 so that a clear subgroup assignment could not be done (). Calculation of a low density copy number profile from the array data indicated a flat genome without relevant chromosomal aberration (Figure ). Deletions of chromosome 9q (PTCH1) were absent. Assessment of overall CpG methylation and CpG island methylation levels of the tumor showed relative CpG hypermethylation compared to other reference classes of MB () (Figure ). There was no family history indicating a tumor predisposition syndrome.\nThe patient started treatment according to the HIT-SIOP PNET 4 protocol on the standard radiotherapy (RT) arm () where he received cranio-spinal RT (23.4 Gy) with boost to the posterior fossa up to 55.8 Gy in 30 fractions over 42 days. Adjuvant chemotherapy started 6 weeks after the end of RT and it includes eight cycles of maintenance chemotherapy (). Treatment was well tolerated with no major life-threatening adverse events or dose limiting toxicities. To date, the patient is in complete remission more than 2 years since diagnosis.\nSeveral mutation databases were searched, namely; the catalog of somatic mutations in cancer (COSMIC) database (), the cBioPortal for cancer genomics database (), the integrative onco genomics (IntOGen) database for mutational cancer drivers (), the cancer genetics web database () as well as the medulloblastoma advanced genomics international consortium (MAGIC) project (). We checked for reported IDH1 and SMARCB1 mutations in MB samples.\nThe COSMIC database reports on IDH1 mutation in only 5 tumor samples from 4 patients with MB; three samples from two adult cases (, ) and two samples from two pediatric patients [(), ICGC PedBrain Tumor Project; unpublished data].

There was a family history of osteoporosis in his maternal grandfather but no family history of autism. The pregnancy was not planned and was not detected until approximately 25 weeks. No scans were performed. He was born at term and was immediately well after birth.\nHis initial development was normal, with gross motor milestones being achieved as expected: he sat up aged 6 months and walked at age 8 months. His speech was delayed; he started speaking at 5 years of age after receiving speech therapy. He was diagnosed with ASD at 3-years of age after concerns were raised at his toddler group. The patient attended a school for children with special needs.\nHe had suffered three fractures: two of his forearm and one of his wrists. Additionally, he had suffered from multiple crush fractures of his thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. The small joints of the fingers were hypermobile, but there was little evidence of hypermobility elsewhere. DXA scans undertaken before commencing bisphosphonate treatment demonstrated reduced BMD, with Z-scores of −2.7 at the lumbar vertebrae and − 2.6 total body measurement when adjusted for age and gender. He had a diagnosis of idiopathic osteoporosis with a bone biopsy at 12-years of age demonstrating severe low turnover cortical and trabecular osteopenia.

He had no history of fever or emesis. Physical examination revealed no abdominal distension or tenderness, and muscle tension was not palpated. Abdominal ultrasonography showed that the right lower quadrant and urinary system were normal. No special treatment was performed, and follow-up was recommended. After 5 days, the boy presented to the general surgery emergency department for aggravating abdominal pain with emesis. Physical examination revealed abdominal tenderness in the left upper abdomen; however, muscle tension was not palpated.\nRoutine blood examination showed a white cell count of 14.71 × 109/L (reference range 4–10 × 109/L) with 67.2% neutrophils and C-reactive protein of 59.65 mg/L (reference range < 8 mg/L). An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan depicted a retroperitoneal occupying lesion in the upper abdomen accompanied by an abdominal aorta dilatation (Fig. ). The child was then admitted to the department of surgical oncology. On admission, the boy's medical history was found to be unremarkable, and his family history contained nothing of significance. Blood pressure (BP) measurement showed that BP in the right upper limb was 178/94 mm Hg. Laboratory tests revealed the following: white cell count, 9400/μL with 62.8% neutrophils; CRP, 46 mg/L; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), 23 mm/h (reference range 0–21 mm/h). Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the aorta showed an aortic pseudoaneurysm (Fig. ). The boy was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for further treatment. An urgent consultation was held with the department of vascular surgery of Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University. An emergency aortic stent implantation and aneurysm embolization were performed the next morning, and the intraoperative diagnosis was aortic pseudoaneurysm (Fig. ).\nAfter the operation, nicardipine hydrochloride and metoprolol were introduced to lower the patient's BP. A consultation with the department of rheumatism determined the diagnosis to be TA, based on the boy's medical history, physical examination, and auxiliary examination results. The patient was then transferred to the department of rheumatism for treatment on May 9. Treatment with prednisolone was initiated (48 mg daily). Five days after the boy received intravenous prednisolone, cyclophosphamide was administered at a dose of 600 mg.

He was a keen rugby player and had experienced an avulsion fracture of the AIIS during a rugby game which was played without a warm up six months previously. MRI just after injury showed a single bony fragment measuring 12 mm × 4 mm × 12 mm at the rectus femoris origin of the AIIS and it was retracted inferiorly 3 cm, anteriorly 1 cm and laterally 0.5 cm. Conservative treatment was advised by the Paediatric Orthopaedic Surgeon and he was referred to a physiotherapist for mobilisation and subsequently muscle strengthening.\nFive months post-injury he was progressing well with the physiotherapy, although, he still felt a sharp pain in his left groin when running with a ball while playing rugby. Flexion was restricted to 70° and a decrease in internal rotation in comparison with the opposite side was observed while abduction, adduction, extension and external rotation were comparable to the other side. There was no significant tenderness and no bruise in the region of the groin, and no distal neurovascular deficit. Plain radiographs demonstrated hypertrophic calcification in the region of the rectus femoris avulsion, whilst the hip joints were normal in appearance. A CT scan showed well corticated heterotopic bone formation at the site, measuring approximately 3.5 cm at maximum diameter (). Motion analysis using the three-dimensional CT datasets clearly showed the impinging area especially in 70° of hip flexion.\nBoth conservative and surgical management were suggested and discussed with the patient and his parents. They chose to go ahead with surgery, as he could not play rugby well because of the pain and restricted range of movement. The patient wanted to play rugby at a fairly high level, hopefully nationally, in the future. At arthroscopy, he was found to have a well corticated large lesion of heterotopic ossification, and it was dissected carefully from the muscles (). Once the dissection was completed, it was extracted via an incision to deliver the lesion. A dynamic impingement test was performed on the table to ensure there was no residual impingement and the impingement lesion was resected with a 5.5 mm arthroscopic burr. A thorough washout was carried out before closure.\nThe patient was advised not to perform any rotational activities in deep flexion for six weeks postoperatively and to follow the 16-week post-operative rehabilitation protocol. He was also advised prophylaxis against heterotopic ossification. Eight weeks following the procedure, the wound had healed well and there were no obvious signs of complications such as infection or deep vein thrombosis. Along with this, he demonstrated a pain-free, fully functional range of movement in his left hip joint and was delighted with his progress. Plain radiographs showed no further signs of calcification (). He was advised to continue to attend physiotherapy for at least another eight weeks and to engage in more gentle sporting activities like cricket and basketball, which he had enjoyed before the injury. At the 1-year follow-up, he remains asymptomatic with a full range of movement in his hip and continues to play rugby at a high level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He presented with increasing abdominal distension of several months' duration and denied fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or loss of appetite. During his admission, a physical examination revealed that the liver edge was palpable 6 cm below the right costal margin and no abdominal tenderness or guarding was present. Laboratory investigations demonstrated slightly elevated lactate dehydrogenase (263 U/L, normal range: 74–250 U/L). His blood count, liver function tests, and other liver enzymes as well as serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) were within normal range. Ultrasonography revealed a partially defined hepatic mass with multiple internal cystic foci, and an increased intralesional vascularization is identified (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen revealed a 17 × 18 × 20 cm heterogeneous predominantly cystic mass with thick internal septations, residual solid tissue, and peripheral neovascular formation in the right hepatic lobe (Figures –). Extended right hepatectomy was performed. Intraoperative frozen section was submitted with interpretation of malignant neoplasm. Grossly, the resected specimen consisted of a 19.5 × 14 × 16 cm well-circumscribed mass with a fibrous pseudocapsule. Cut surface of the tumor showed a variegated appearance of gray, solid glistening tumor alternating with soft gelatinous areas with dark-brown and yellow-green areas of hemorrhage and necrosis (). On microscopic examination, the tumor contains alternating hypocellular myxoid areas and hypercellular areas. It was comprised predominantly of pleomorphic cells that are spindle, oval, or stellate shaped and distributed in a fibrous or myxoid stroma (Figures –). Some areas showed fibroblast-like fascicles and bundles. Focally, tumor cells were highly bizarre, with occasional large anaplastic multinucleated giant cells. Atypical mitotic figures were easily identified. Few sharply defined eosinophilic hyaline globules in the tumor cell cytoplasm were observed (). Entrapped bile ducts and hepatic cords were present in areas at the periphery of the tumor (). By immunohistochemistry, tumor cells stained positively for vimentin and alpha1-antitrypsin, partially positive for desmin, and negative for myogenin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), and pancytokeratin (AE1/AE3) (Figures –). The AE1/AE3 stain highlighted the entrapped bile ducts (). The surgical margin was free. On the basis of these findings, a pathological diagnosis of UESL was made. Postoperative positron emission tomography (PET) scan did not reveal residual or metastatic disease. A five-month course of chemotherapy (VAdrC/VIE) including vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and etoposide was received, starting at 4 weeks after the operation, and he tolerated the chemotherapy well. The patient has been followed with imaging studies, including a whole-body PET scan.\nAt 48 months of follow-up, surveillance MRI showed a hyperintense, 7 mm lung lesion on T2-weighted images but PET scan was negative. Chest CT imaging at 50 months following the hepatectomy revealed a 1.7 × 1.4 cm lung nodule in the left lower lobe () with no pleural or pericardial effusions. There was left hepatic lobe hypertrophy with no evidence of local tumor recurrence. The patient underwent lateral thoracotomy with wedge resection of the left lower lobe nodule. Macroscopically, the resected specimen consisted of a well-demarcated mass measuring 1.5 × 1.2 × 0.9 cm with soft and gelatinous cut surface. Histopathological studies revealed that the tumor was composed of pleomorphic stellate and spindled neoplastic cells in a predominantly myxoid matrix; scattered bizarre multinucleated giant cells and atypical mitotic figures were frequently seen (Figures –). No evident intracellular or extracellular eosinophilic hyaline globules were observed. There were bronchioles entrapped within and at the periphery of the tumor (Figures and ). Few isolated bronchioles were focally destroyed by the infiltrating tumor. Background lung parenchyma revealed atelectasis and marked vascular congestion. By immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells were strongly and diffusely positive for vimentin, α1-antitrypsin, and CD10, patchy positive for desmin, CD56, and BCL2, rare staining for CD68, and negative for myogenin and AE1/AE3 (Figures –). The entrapped bronchiolar epithelium was highlighted by AE1/AE3 (). The pathological findings are consistent with metastases of the UESL. A chemotherapy regimen with olaratumab plus doxorubicin was received. At the time of this report, he is 9 months after wedge resection and remains well with no evidence of tumor recurrence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Suddenly, he was bitten on his right leg by a snake which was described by onlookers as long and brown in colour. Upon noticing the bite, he rushed home where a black stone was tied at the site of the bite and prayers were invoked. Soon after, he started frothing at the mouth and had labored breathing. A cousin rushed him to the nearest health facility (Gede dispensary in Watamu), where they were immediately referred to Bio-Ken Snake Farm. They arrived at Bio-Ken Snake Farm about an hour after the bite had occurred. Once at Bio-Ken, he was immediately driven by Sanda Ashe, a director at Bio-Ken to Watamu Hospital, a journey which took less than 10 min. On arrival, two bite marks could be seen on his right mid-shin with no signs of edema. He was sweating profusely, hypersalivating with severe ptosis, and his pupils were non-responsive to light (). His blood pressure was unrecordable, his heart rate was 100 beats per minute but thready, and body temperature was 35.5 °C. He was semi-comatose (Glasgow Coma Scale: 9/15) and oxygen saturation was 83%. Evaluation of the respiratory rate and ECG were not performed.\nSuction was initiated to clear the secretions and oxygen administered via an ambu-bag. Two ampoules (20 mL) of South African Vaccine Producers (SAVP) polyvalent antivenom was administered to the patient by rapid IV push. Furthermore, two other ampoules (20 mL) were given in a 500 mL IV infusion of 0.9% w/v normal saline. Extra IV lines were run at 10, 15, and 20 min intervals. In total, four vials of antivenom were used. About 10 min after antivenom infusion, the patient developed severe urticaria for which adrenaline 0.5 mL was administered subcutaneously. Ambu-bagging was the only means of resuscitation available and the victim was bag ventilated over a period of two hours with oxygen via an oxygen cylinder ().\nA clinical officer, a nurse, a nurse assistant, and the physician all took turns hand-ventilating the patient. In the course of ambu-bagging and IV infusion of antivenom, the victim went into cardiac arrest on two occasions. There were no cardiac sounds on auscultation and his pulse could not be detected. Similarly, no readings could be observed on the screen of the pulse oximeter. Chest compressions lasting 3–5 min were then immediately initiated on both occasions to complement artificial ventilation. This was stopped when cardiac sounds could be heard on auscultation, and readings could be observed on the screen of the pulse oximeter. At this point, his pulse was fluctuating and, thus, presumed post-resuscitation hemodynamic instability was corrected using IV infusion of Ringers lactate and normal saline (three litres over 24 h) until his pulse stabilized at 95 BPM. Ambu-bagging was continued for a further five and a half hours until pulse oximeter readings stabilized at 95–98% and a strong pulse could be felt. At this time, his temperature was 36.5 °C, BP was 110/70, pulse was 88/min (and strong) and oxygen saturation was 99%. He was then weaned off oxygen and admitted for further monitoring. Over the course of the next day, he could breathe on his own and had no neurological impairment. (). He could recall all the events leading up to his arrival at the hospital and was also able to identify members of his family who had visited him at the hospital. Bio-Ken later confirmed the snake to be a black mamba. Given the remarkable progress made by the patient, the absence of neurological impairment or any other organ dysfunction, the decision was made not to refer the patient.\nIt is worth noting that Watamu Hospital is a small private hospital with a capacity of eight beds. The facility is located 422 km southeast of Nairobi (3.3622° S, 40.0017° E) in a rural area on Turtle Bay Road in Watamu. The hospital has a basic laboratory and the bite occurred on a day (Sunday) when the hospital operates with minimum staff. Moreover, the nearest referral hospital (Malindi County Hospital) is 25 km away and lacks appropriate antivenom. Therefore, the main focus of this intervention was resuscitation of the patient. Apart from what we have highlighted, it was not possible to do more. Thankfully, the patient had no neurological impairment or any organ dysfunction. He is currently volunteering at the Bio-Ken Snake Farm where he assists in the care of the captured snakes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He had recently traveled to the southern region of Saudi Arabia. No bowel or bladder symptoms were present. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient by King Fahd Hospital of the University, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University.\nClinical examination revealed tenderness of the lower back region on palpation and a reduction in the strength of both knees and hip during extension and flexion (grade 3/5), with sensory loss in both lower limbs on pinprick examination. Other parameters on neurological examination were intact. Laboratory results revealed anemia with mild leukocytosis and peripheral eosinophilia. All other results of routine laboratory tests were within the reference range.\nAn X-ray examination of the lumbar spine showed no gross abnormality. Emergent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed cord edema with an abnormal signal intensity in the thoracic and lumbar regions (Figs. , ). The clinical and laboratory findings of the radiological features indicated acute transverse myelitis secondary to infectious or inflammatory changes. However, the possibility of other differentials remained. A lumbar puncture was performed using standard procedures. Gram staining and culture of the cerebrospinal fluid yielded negative results. No isolated parasitic eggs were present in the urine or stool specimens. Brain MRI findings were unremarkable. However, the Schistosoma serology titer showed a marked elevation.\nTherefore, a presumptive diagnosis of neuroschistosomiasis was made, and an experimental oral treatment for schistosomiasis was prescribed without any spinal intervention. The patient’s symptoms and signs rapidly subsided, with a regression of the spinal myelitis pattern on follow-up MRI examination (Figs. , ). Subsequently, he was discharged from the hospital within 1 week in dependable health and continued his anti-microbial regimen for 1 month. Follow-up examinations at the neurology clinic revealed a gradual improvement in the patient’s clinical condition. The patient was referred for further follow-up in the infection clinic.

She is the first child of a consanguineous (second-degree relatives) couple. Both parents are healthy and have never had fractures. During her first year of life, she had delayed motor development and growth failure. At one year of age, she could not sit by herself and weighed 7.5 kg (< 3rd centile). She presented to our hospital at 14 months of age with fractures of both femora without a history of significant trauma. She was found to have ptosis of both eyes with normal teeth but no blue sclerae. She was small for her age. Her weight was 7.8 kg (3rd centile) and her length was 68 cm (< 3rd centile). Skeletal survey showed diffuse osteopenia, multiple healed fractures of the right humoral shaft, both tibiae and fibulae. Spine radiograph showed flattening and indentation of vertebral bodies (Fig. ). A diagnosis of OI was made and intravenous bisphosphonate therapy (pamidronate 1 mg/kg/dose for 3 days) was initiated and given every 3 months. However, she sustained 1–2 long bone fractures per year from minor trauma. She required multiple corrective osteotomies to correct her deformities. At the last follow-up, she was 14 years old, weighing 20 kg. She could not walk due to her long bone deformity (Fig. ). Remarkably, although she was in a special education class due to physical disabilities, her cognition was appropriate for age. She could talk fluently and do mathematics properly.\nPrenatally, her younger sister was found to have a dilated fourth ventricle by an ultrasonography. She was born at term via cesarean section because of previous cesarean section and was diagnosed with hydrocephalus at birth. At 4 months of age, she had her first fracture without a history of a significant trauma, leading to a diagnosis of OI. Physical examination revealed a head circumference of 38 cm (> 95th centile) with a wide anterior fontanelle (3 × 3 cm.) and blue sclerae. She had global developmental delay (could not hold her head) and hypotonia. MRI of the brain demonstrated a large posterior fossa cyst connecting with the fourth ventricular system, moderate hydrocephalus, hypoplasia of cerebellar hemisphere with absence of cerebellar vermis, and hypoplasia of corpus collosum. She was also diagnosed with vesicoureteral reflux grade V and gastroesophageal reflux requiring tube feeding. The patient had multiple hospitalizations because of recurrent urinary tract infections and pneumonia. She expired at the age of one year.\nSixteen known OI genes, BMP1, COL1A1, COL1A2, CREB3L1, CRTAP, FKBP10, IFITM5, LEPRE1, PLOD2, PPIB, SERPINF1, SERPINH1, SP7, TMEM38B, WNT1, and MBTPS2, were amplified from 200 ng of genomic DNA using the Truseq Custom Amplicon Sequencing kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). 286 amplicons which covered all the 226 exons (28 kb) of the target genes were sequenced by Miseq (Illumina, San Diego, CA) using 2 × 250 paired-end reads. SNVs and Indels were detected by Miseq reporter software. The proband was found to harbor a homozygous mutation, c.6delG, p.Leu3Serfs*36 in WNT1. The mutation has never been reported in Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD; ) (Fig. ). The mutation was subsequently confirmed by PCR-Sanger sequencing. Segregation analysis was performed by using primers, WNT1-E1F: GGT TGTTAAAGCCAGACTGC and WNT1-E1R: ACCAGCTCACTTACCACCAT.

She had a fever of 38 °C once a few days before. Physical evaluation revealed a swollen and painful left leg with reduced range of motion of the left hip and bumps palpated on the right tibia proximal metaphysis. No signs of arthritis, possible intestinal inflammation or skin changes were seen during physical evaluation. The patient’s blood pressure and urinary output were normal. After the emergency ultrasound exam revealed a diagnosis of femoral and pelvic deep vein thrombosis, she was admitted to the hospital. According to her parents, the patient had had no chronic diseases to date. They indicated that she had a foot fracture at the age of 8 years. There were no autoimmune or auto-inflammatory disorders in the patient’s family history.\nInitial investigations revealed high levels of inflammatory markers (CRP and ESR), and a severe microcytic anaemia as well as thrombocytosis, hypoalbuminemia and elevated fibrinogen concentration and D-dimer values (Table ). Suspecting an infectious cause, a urinalysis was performed, and haematuria and proteinuria were detected. Both blood and urine cultures were sterile. X-rays of the legs were done (Fig. ), showing sites of hyperostosis and sclerosis in the metaphysis of the right tibia along with a periosteal reaction, suggesting a possible osteomyelitis or oncological processes in the bones. As the diagnosis of acute osteomyelitis could not be disproved, broad-spectrum antibiotics were prescribed. However, the CRP level did not change significantly over the first few days, so other causes of acute thrombosis and inflammation were investigated. An abdominal ultrasound showed a giant, homogenous pelvic mass and hydronephrosis of the left kidney. Kidney function was quite abnormal as the creatinine level was 185 μmol/L and urinary protein excretion of 7 g over 24 h was detected. Within the next few days the patient’s kidney function deteriorated further, with a creatinine value increasing to 307 μmol/L with poor urine output and high blood pressure. The patient had no prior history of kidney problems.\nDue to the findings of the abdominal ultrasound and leg X-ray, the child underwent a whole-body computed tomography (CT) scan. Multiple bone lesions were observed, the most severe of which were located in the left scapula, the fifth rib projection near the spine and a large deformity of the left pelvic bone close to the acetabulum (Fig. ). The left iliopsoas muscle also appeared to be abnormal. Moreover, renal parenchymal thickening and oedema were found. Investigations for possible endocrine disorders were performed (Table ). Signs of hyperparathyroidism were present together with hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesaemia and a low vitamin D3 concentration, as well as hypocalciuria in the 24-h urine test and hyperphosphaturia based on phosphate fractional excretion (Table ).\nBone and left kidney biopsies were performed. The bone biopsy from the affected site of the left pelvic bone demonstrated intertrabecular stromal fibrosis, several epithelioid granulomas with a central zone of necrosis and polymorphonuclear cells. Moreover, histological evaluation showed a few sites with plasma cell infiltration, including some cells positive for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4). Histological examination of the surrounding connective tissue found mucoid oedema. The renal biopsy revealed an acute and active crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN) with ANCA-associated vasculitis (Fig. ). Special staining was performed for the kidney sample, and no IgG subclasses were found.\nDue to the results of left kidney biopsy together with thrombosis of the deep veins, additional screening for autoimmune diseases was carried out. The child tested positive for antinuclear antibodies (ANA 1:100), antibodies against centromere protein B (anti-CENP B), antibodies against proliferating cell nuclear antigens (anti-PCNA) and C-ANCA (Table ). High levels of ferritin were also found (448 μg/L), indicating the possibility of both autoimmune and thrombotic causes of anaemia. However, antiphospholipid antibodies were not detected. Concerning the bone biopsy results, serum IgG levels were tested and only IgG4 was slightly increased (Table ).\nSince multiple bone lesions were detected, the fracture history was reviewed. At the age of 8 years our patient had not only a foot fracture, but also complained of pain in the left elbow and back. It appeared that she was diagnosed with CRMO at that time, based on the results of a biopsy from the fracture site as well as a CT of the left foot (Fig. ) and a whole-body radionuclide scan. The radionuclide scan showed multiple sites of CRMO lesions, with three in the spine, one in the left hand, one in the left scapula, one in the left pelvic bone and two in the right leg. Surgery for the broken foot was performed and treatment with antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was prescribed for a month. When the patient’s pain decreased over time, analgesics were discontinued due to the impression of a self-limiting disease course. For the next 6 years she was free from complaints except for painless unilateral right periorbital oedema appearing on and off for the last 2–3 years and observed without medical supervision. Due to this oedema and slight exophthalmos of the right eye during current episode, additional head and spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, and a new CRMO lesion in a right periorbital region was diagnosed (Fig. ) together with deformation and lipoid degeneration of the seventh neck vertebrae (Fig. ).\nTreatment was started for the vasculitis with cyclophosphamide and prednisolone according to the renal-limited vasculitis management protocol. No pain reliever was necessary. Severe metabolic disturbances and hyperparathyroidism were treated with alfacalcidol, calcium and magnesium supplements. Kidney and ureter stents were placed for 1 month due to hydronephrosis. Secondary GN-associated hypertension was treated with ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors. Anticoagulants were prescribed for deep vein thrombosis for 6 months until full recanalisation of the left femoral vein had occurred.\nAfter 1.5 years of treatment, the child is free of complaints. Her auto-inflammatory, metabolic and endocrinological conditions are being monitored by a multidisciplinary team of physicians. All microelements and parathormone levels are within the normal range. There are no signs of hypertension and the patient’s kidney function has recovered. To date, there are no clinical or diagnostic signs of deep vein thrombosis. The patient is still on maintenance treatment with azathioprine according to the kidney vasculitis treatment protocol and receiving microelements supplementation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While being admitted for depression and suicidality, she also complained of exacerbation of her bilateral leg pain, which significantly limited her mobility and worsened her mood.\nShe was admitted two months prior for bilateral generalized neuropathic leg pain which limited her mobility. A lumbar magnetic resonance image (MRI) was unremarkable. She tried multiple classes of pain medications including acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentinoids, antiepileptics, and opioids. Additional interventions included acupuncture, physical therapy, occupational therapy, guided imagery therapy, and epidural steroid injection.\nUpon readmission for suicidality, the pain management team was consulted. On her psychiatric evaluation, patient had a depressed, flat affect endorsing suicidality. The patient reported despair regarding her chronic pain as well as flashbacks to a previous concussion after a fall several years prior with subsequent development of her neuropathic type pain. She had also reported several instances of self-injurious behaviors including cutting and two suicide attempts with a shoelace and pillowcase. She was placed on continuous observation. The patient's chronic outpatient psychiatric medications include fluoxetine and aripiprazole. While she was an inpatient, the patient was also trialed on bupropion but was discontinued due to increased agitation and irritability. She also reported severe burning bilateral leg pain. In addition, she described her pain in terms of “shooting”, reporting painful paresthesias, dysesthesias, and hyperalgesia as well as a “numbness” characterization to her bilateral leg pain, which followed a neuropathic pattern.\nHer lumbar spine was mildly tender to palpation, but her neurological exam was otherwise intact. While her characterization of pain was neuropathic in nature, she did not meet the criteria for complex regional pain syndrome. There were no allodynic features, vasomotor, pseudomotor, or tropic changes on exam. Despite her prescribed regimen of pregabalin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, lidocaine 5% patch, tizanidine, and subsequently oxycodone as needed, her pain continued. She had also been tried previously on morphine with also minimal efficacy. The patient also underwent a ten-day trial of duloxetine with minimal improvement and reported worsening severe depressive symptoms, suicidal ideations, and neuropathic pain. It was then recommended to start an intravenous ketamine infusion which was theorized to have a more rapid clinical onset and effect.\nPatient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit for intravenous ketamine infusion and monitoring. Prior to starting intravenous ketamine infusion, her leg pain was rated 7/10 on the numerical rating scale (NRS, 0-10 with 10 being the worst pain) of burning quality. There was no weakness or changes in sensation, though there was limited mobility secondary to pain. Intravenous ketamine infusion was started at 7 micrograms/kilogram/minute (mcg/kg/min). The ketamine infusion was used 24 hours per day for the entire duration of the treatment with ketamine infusion. The total dose was titrated based on the specific mcg/kg/min. The patient's weight (72 kg) was used for the dosing calculation.\nThe patient remained hemodynamically stable with no dysphoria or hallucinations. On day one of intravenous ketamine infusion, the patient had significant improvement of her depressive symptoms, as noted by psychiatry and pain management teams, and the maximum NRS throughout the day was 6/10. On day two, she reported less pain in her legs with a maximum NRS of 5/10, and significant improvement in her mood with no further suicidal ideations. On day three, intravenous ketamine infusion was increased to 8 micrograms/kilogram/minute; however physical exam revealed nystagmus and visual changes and was decreased to 7 micrograms/kilogram/minute. Patient's pain maximum NRS score remained at 5/10. On day four, maximum NRS score reduced to 4/10 and self-reported 70% pain relief since initiation of intravenous ketamine infusion. She also had functional improvement in her legs and was able to ambulate freely. On day five, dosage was titrated down to 4 micrograms/kilogram/minute with maximum NRS score of 0/10 and sustained improvement in mood. Intravenous ketamine infusion was further reduced to 2 micrograms/kilogram/minute and discontinued that same day. She was able to tolerate physical therapy and maintain analgesia. Psychiatric reassessment determined her to be no longer at suicide risk, and she was discharged with no immediate sequelae and was placed on chronic aripiprazole, topiramate, and lithium by her outpatient psychiatrist.\nThe patient had five months of symptom relief after her first intravenous ketamine infusion. She was readmitted five months later with repeated suicide attempts, depression, and worsening bilateral upper and lower extremity neuropathic pain, though with decreased baseline NRS. Due to her dramatic improvement and sustained relief with intravenous ketamine infusion during her last admission, as well as the lack of other successful treatment options, she was again admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for five days of intravenous ketamine infusion with resolution of her neuropathic pain and suicidal/depressive symptoms allowing for discharge home without any immediate sequelae.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JeSsiCa aDaMS,14,F,AB-,Diabetes,18-12-2021,Emily Madden,"Woodard, and Reyes Burton",Cigna,49029.88573,416,Elective,05-01-2022,Lipitor,Inconclusive,"The proband is a 14-year-old previously healthy female born to nonconsanguineous healthy parents who was admitted for having fever, fatigue, lower quadrant abdominal pain, and vomiting. Abdominal computerized tomography (CT) revealed significant hydronephrosis consistent with a right ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction, for which she underwent ureteral stent placement on hospital day 2. Her postoperative course was complicated by continued abdominal pain and fever, as well as an episode of rectal prolapse. Of note, she also endorsed an episode of rectal prolapse months prior to presentation which was manually reduced at home. On hospital day 6, due to continued fevers, abdominal and pelvic MRI was obtained. This study revealed a pelvic fluid collection concerning abscess; CT guided transgluteal drainage performed by Interventional Radiology resulted in 150ml cloudy yellow fluid. The etiology was believed to be an infected urinoma caused by instrumentation during stent placement and she was treated with ceftriaxone and metronidazole. The patient's fevers and pain continued, prompting an abdominal and pelvic CT on hospital day 10. The imaging was notable for diffuse ascites, bowel wall thickening, and organizing fluid collections within the pelvis. She ultimately went for exploratory laparotomy and washout with intraoperative findings of multiple pockets of turbid fluid. The entire bowel was evaluated and there was no evidence of perforations, fistulas, or other causes of gastrointestinal leakage. Peritoneal fluid cultures grew polymicrobial organisms, however, suggestive of gut flora. She was transitioned to meropenem and fevers eventually resolved prior to discharge.\nTwo months following discharge the patient underwent outpatient elective appendectomy, right pyeloplasty, and ureterotomy with stent placement due to persistent hydronephrosis. Pathology revealed normal appendix tissue. Ureter pathology was significant only for acute and chronic inflammation, with no evidence of malignancy. Routine screening abdominal ultrasound 2 months later revealed stable hydronephrosis; however, an incidental 3cm soft tissue mass presumed to be near the sigmoid colon was noted. Follow-up MRI showed nearly circumferential thickening of the sigmoid colon which was subsequently evaluated by esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy. Findings were significant for 9-10 sessile polyps in transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon with large cluster of irregular appearing polyps in the sigmoid (). Histologic evaluation of the sigmoid polyp revealed invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with extensive lymphovascular invasion. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated the carcinoma to be positive for CDX-2, villin, and CK7 and negative for CK20 and WT-1 (). The lack of CK20 suggested a possible primary upper gastrointestinal or hepatobiliary primary tumor; however this was not found on endoscopy or suggested on previous imaging. Further immunohistochemical staining revealed no loss of expression of MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6. There was complete loss of expression of PMS2; this testing was deemed indeterminate due to lack of staining in both tumor tissues and normal tissue.\nThe patient underwent repeat colonoscopy approximately 3 weeks after her first procedure with an adult interventional gastroenterologist. Findings were significant for two tubular adenomas in the colon at 25cm and 30cm from the anus, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma at 24cm, a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the rectum (10-15cm), and an anorectal mass with moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma arising in the background of tubulovillous adenoma with extensive high-grade dysplasia. Both tubular adenomas were removed by snare polypectomy, while the remaining masses were biopsied. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for CDX2, CK7, CK20, and villin. There was no loss of expression of MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6, suggesting intact proteins. There was again loss of expression of PMS2 in both tumor and nontumoral cells () consistent with complete protein loss. Genetic testing revealed biallelic pathogenic PMS2 variants: NM 000535: c.137 G>T; NP 0005261: pS46I and c.1831dupA (frameshift). Familial testing concluded that one variant was inherited from each parent, with her asymptomatic brother also carrying the father's PMS2 variant.\nDue to the findings of invasive disease as well as previous pelvic fluid suggestive of a microperforation, the diagnosis of Stage 4 adenocarcinoma was established. Chemotherapy was initiated with Capecitabine (pyrimidine analog) followed by two cycles of FOLFOX6 (Oxaliplatin, Leucovorin, and 5-FU), as well as 6 weeks of radiation. She finally underwent total colectomy along with total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingectomy, and pathology revealed no evidence of residual adenocarcinoma in the colon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A blood cell count revealed severe thrombocytopenia at 13 × 109/L and hemoglobin of 80 g/L. A CT scan showed a 36 mL right parieto-occipital hematoma with significant perilesional edema and mass effect (Figure A). She received first-line therapy including corticosteroids, IVIg, and platelet transfusion. Subsequently, she had a generalized tonic–clonic seizure. On the third day, she was transferred to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of Saint Pierre (Reunion Island, France), which is equipped with a neurosurgical department.\nAfter admission, the neurological status of the patient deteriorated, with coma and anisocoria related to cerebral hematoma growth (50 mL) (Figure B). A barbiturate-induced coma was required to control ICHT, and corticotherapy was intensified because of persistent severe thrombocytopenia. The day after, ICHT remained uncontrolled. Salvage surgery was performed (craniotomy with hematoma evacuation). Despite massive platelet transfusion in the perioperative period, the PC remained below 15 × 109/L before the procedure, which was complicated by significant subcutaneous bleeding (Figure C). Consequently, romiplostim was initiated at the advice of the hematologist, with a first administration the day after surgery and a second course 1 week later. At this point, a PC of 81 × 109/L was achieved, largely due to a massive platelet transfusion. A sustainable “complete response” was achieved only 6 days after romiplostim administration. We noted a PC peak of 1,554 × 109/L 2 weeks after the second romiplostim injection, without clinical consequences. No further hemorrhage expansion or new bleeding into the craniotomy site was noted on follow-up brain imaging (Figure D). No hemorrhagic complication was observed related to the intraparenchymal ICP monitor (Figure E) placed at the end of the surgical procedure. ICP was initially measured at 27 mmHg and then decreased gradually by continuing sedation for a few more days.\nEighteen days after her hospitalization the patient was discharged from intensive care with left residual hemiparesis. She full recovered a few months later.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DenisE rOdRIGuEZ,14,F,A-,Hypertension,02-03-2020,Susan Gibson,Rodriguez Ltd,Cigna,22564.78798,408,Elective,07-03-2020,Paracetamol,Normal,"A 14 year old girl developed diarrhoea and vomiting and presented to hospital four days after symptom onset following a fainting episode. She had also experienced sharp colicky pains in her abdomen. She had been on holiday in the United Kingdom prior to the episode.\nThe patient had developed nephrotic syndrome at age 13 with a renal biopsy showing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. She also had mild asthma, menorrhagia and pulmonary stenosis (diagnosed on echocardiogram).\nHer medications included tacrolimus, enalapril, atrovastatin, omeprazole, penicillin-V, levothyroxine and ferrous fumarate. The tacrolimus had been stopped a day before the start of illness as it had not produced any improvement in renal function or reduction in proteinuria. The tacrolimus had been commenced 14 months earlier at a dose of 5 mg twice daily. A tacrolimus level had last been assayed 2 months before onset of her illness. This was 7.3 µg l−1 i.e. within the normal therapeutic range.\nOn admission, she was felt to be fluid-depleted with mild dehydration and after initial treatment with a bolus of 500 ml of normal saline in the emergency department, was commenced on intravenous fluids in view of abdominal pain and vomiting. Her renal function was deranged with an acute kidney injury score of 2. Urea was 22.8 mmol l−1, previously having being in the range of 6.5–11.8 mmol l−1 and creatinine was raised to 157 µmol l−1, previously having being in the range of 70–95 µmol l−1. Liver function tests were normal. White blood cell count was normal (6.1×109 l−1). Enalapril was stopped in view of these results. She improved after 24 h of maintenance IV fluid therapy with 0.9 % saline and 5 % dextrose, renal function returning to previous levels (urea 16.7 mmol l−1, Creatinine 94 µmol l−1) and she was discharged. Subsequently, Cryptosporidium was detected on stool microscopy. This was confirmed to be Cryptosporidium hominis by PCR at the national reference laboratory. The sample was negative for all other pathogens tested for, including Escherichia coli 0157, Campylobacter, Salmonella and Shigella. Following discharge she continued to have some episodes of diarrhoea but no vomiting. She re-presented 19 days later with significant abdominal pain and infrequent small vomits which were non bilious, her diarrhoea had resolved.\nOn examination she had epigastric tenderness but no hepatomegaly. Her perfusion was adequate with a capillary refill time <2 s, pulse rate of 89, blood pressure was 104/58, both within the normal range for her age. However, her peripheral pulses were poor. She was commenced on maintenance intravenous fluids with 0.9 % saline and 5 % dextrose. Liver function tests were noted to be deranged with raised aspartate transaminase (451 IU l−1), alanine transaminase (267 IU l−1), gamma-glutamyl transferase (115 IU l−1) and lactate dehydrogenase (853 IU l−1). Her renal function showed raised urea (10 mmol l−1) and creatinine (72 µmol l−1) which were above baseline but within her usual range. Her liver function continued to deteriorate over the next 24 h (peak aspartate transaminase 1062 IU l−1, alanine transaminase 1292 IU l−1, lactate dehydrogenase 882 IU l−1, gamma-glutamyl transferase 209 IU l−1). An ultrasound showed a thickened gall bladder but otherwise normal liver and bile duct.\nAfter discussing the history and results with specialist paediatric hepatologists who, in view of the facts, that her stool was positive for Cryptosporidium hominis, she had worsening liver function tests and ultrasound evidence of cholangitis, recommended a three day oral course of nitazoxanide 500 mg twice daily. Following this, her liver function tests rapidly improved, returning almost to baseline after 4 days. Her appetite returned to normal and her abdominal symptoms resolved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CALeB MADDoX,14,F,AB-,Arthritis,21-01-2020,Joanne Bates,Matthews-Beck,Blue Cross,42935.04998,116,Emergency,04-02-2020,Aspirin,Abnormal,"A 14-year-old girl came to Thammasat University Hospital for renal replacement therapy. She presented with end-stage renal disease (oliguria, anemia, and failure to thrive). She was the first child of healthy nonconsanguineous Thai parents. She was born at term to a 23-year-old mother and a 25-year-old father. Her prenatal and perinatal periods were uncomplicated. Her development was unremarkable until six months of age. She clawed by using her knees and elbows, instead of hands, at the age of 8 months. She was unable to walk on her feet but moved on her knees during her childhood period. She came to our hospital at the age of 12 years. Her weight was 25.4 kilograms (below the 3rd percentile) and her sitting height was 70 cm (below the 3rd percentile). Her vitals were normal, except high blood pressure at 120/80 mmHg (above 99th percentile for her age, sex, and height). She had pallor. Her distinctive facial features were the cloudy cornea, exophthalmos, underdeveloped ala nasi, maxillary hypoplasia, and micrognathia (). Upper extremity deformities included shortening of arms and forearms, flexion contracture of elbows, distorted wrists, and shortening of all fingers. Deformities of lower extremities were short thighs, short-bowed legs, and flexion contracture of knee. Distorted and restricted in motion of ankles, and deformities of feet were observed. Her heart, lungs, abdomen, and neurological examination were unremarkable. Her cognitive was appropriated with age.\nHer initial investigations demonstrated blood urea nitrogen 120 mg/dL, serum creatinine 8.3 mg/dL, Na 134, K 4.5, Cl 95, HCO3 11 mmol/L, phosphate 2.6, calcium 3.8 mg/dL, albumin 0.6 g/dL, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 13.5 U/L, with parathyroid hormone (PTH) level at 94 pg/ml. Her radiography of the upper extremities showed absence of carpal bones, osteolytic lesions of metacarpal, and distal ends of ulna and radial bones (). The radiography of the lower extremities demonstrated absence of tarsal bones, osteolytic lesions of metatarsal bones, and distal end of fibula (). In addition, severe cortical thinning of all bones indicating osteopenia was observed (Figures and ).\nUltrasonography showed small size of both kidneys and echocardiography demonstrated left ventricular hypertrophy. The diagnosis of end-stage renal disease was made with estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 7 mL/min/1.73 m2. All clinical presentation and investigations were compatible with the clinical diagnosis of MCTO. She received hemodialysis followed by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and medications including erythropoietin, ferrous fumarate, 0.50 µg of calcitriol, and 1400 mg of elemental calcium. Six months later, she developed generalized tonic-clonic seizure from hypercalcemia (12.4 mg/dL). Her serum chemistry demonstrated normal serum phosphorus level (3.9 mg/dL) and low serum alkaline phosphatase (4 U/L), with normal serum PTH level at 103 pg/mL. These findings indicated a marked reduction in the bone uptake of calcium after a period of calcium supplement. Calcium and calcitriol were discontinued until serum calcium returned to normal level, then only 720 mg of elemental calcium was reintroduced. Two years later, she had a slightly high serum calcium level (10.8 mg/dL), normal serum phosphorus level (3.5 mg/dL), and normal PTH level (113 pg/ml). Interestingly, during the past 2 years, we observed persistently low serum ALP levels (2.6–4.9 U/L) [], indicating poor osteoblastic activity and limited bone formation. Thus, impaired bone mineralization from dysregulation of osteoblast and osteoclast was suspected and MAFB mutation might be responsible for MCTO disease in this patient.\nWe performed a genetic testing, MAFB sequencing on her and her parental blood. The genomic were isolated from peripheral lymphocytes using Puregene DNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). A short region of the amino-terminal transcriptional activation domain of the MAFB gene, containing mutation hotspots, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We designed primers by using software (Primer3Plus). The forward and reverse primer sequences for PCR amplification were 5′-GCTCAAGT TCGACGTGAAGA-3′ and 5′-GTAGTTGCTCGCCATCCAGT-3′, respectively. PCR products were visualized on a 2% agarose gel and purified using DyeEx 2.0 spin kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The products were then sequenced by capillary electrophoresis. This study was approved by the ethic committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Thammasat University, Thailand (MTU-EC-PE-1-005/59).\nWe identified a de novo heterozygous missense mutation at nucleotide 197 from C to G (NM_005461.4; c.197C > G; ), predicting the change of amino acid at codon 66 from serine to cysteine (p.Ser66Cys). There was negative in both mother and father's result. This missense mutation occurred within the transactivation domain of MafB protein. This serine at the codon 66 is evolutionarily conserved among species, and in silico prediction of pathogenicity programs classify this variant as deleterious (SIFT) and probably damaging (PolyPhen).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ALeXaNdRa ESPINOzA,14,F,B+,Asthma,22-11-2020,Dustin Mann DDS,"Miranda, Terry and Hancock",Blue Cross,46453.90845,278,Elective,16-12-2020,Aspirin,Abnormal,"A 14-years-old girl came to our attention because of severe and persistent lymphopenia during an episode of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Her familiar history was negative for invasive infections and autoimmune diseases. Patient medical history was unremarkable for infections. In addition, previous blood counts were normal. The study conformed to all the protocols of Asst Spedali Civili of Brescia. Informed consent for blood tests and genetic studies was obtained from her parents.\nShe presented with acute onset anemia (hemoglobin 5.5 g/dl) with positive direct antiglobulin test (Coombs test, IgG 2+), normal platelets (299.000/μL), and white cell count (total leucocytes 5.760/μL, neutrophils 4.160/μL, lymphocytes 1.330/μL). At the beginning she was treated with oral prednisone (2 mg/kg/day), but poor response to the treatment was observed. Therefore, she was switched to four intravenous pulses of methylprednisolone each one at 2 mg/kg within 72 h, followed by intravenous immunoglobulins (1 g/kg).\nThe laboratory tests showed normal white cell counts, except for marked lymphopenia (Figure ), reduction of CD4+ cells (ranging from 50 to 300 cells/μL), increase of fetal hemoglobin, (6.4–13.9% during follow-up), supposedly related to reticulocytosis. While autoantibodies, including Anti-Nuclear Antibodies, Extractable Nuclear Antigen, Anti-DNA antibodies, Anti-Smooth Muscle Antibodies, Anti-phospholipid Antibodies, complement factors, and serum immunoglobulins were within the normal ranges. Immunological screening for celiac and thyroid disease were also negative. Serologic tests for Parvovirus B19, EBV, CMV, and Waaler-Rose test, were consistent with prior infection or non-immunized state. The fecal occult blood test was negative; chest radiograph, echocardiography and abdomen ultrasound were all unremarkable.\nShe underwent also bone marrow aspirate, that showed normal proportion of myeloid cells, presence of megakaryocytes, and mild dyserythropoiesis, without evidence of cytogenetic abnormalities.\nDuring corticosteroid therapy, hemoglobin levels slowly increased and Coombs test became negative within 3 months. Prednisone (1 mg/kg/bid) was continued for 10 months with progressive tapering. However, this therapy was associated with multiple side effects, such as alopecia, weight gain, moon face, stretch marks, including lymphopenia. This was also associated with reduction of IgG concentrations (IgG 520, n.v. 640–1909 mg/dl; IgM 115, n.v. 59–297 mg/dl, IgA 121, n.v. 61–301 mg/dl) which prompted us to start IVIG every 4 weeks for 3 months. In addition, because of the risks related to lymphopenia and to prolonged immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids, prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole and acyclovir was prescribed.\nIn order to exclude an underling immunodeficiency, we examined lymphocyte subsets. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping showed marked alterations in the distributions of the T-lymphocytes (Table ): reduction of the CD3+CD4+ T cells (19.7%), especially the Recent Thymus Emigrants (RTE) CD4+ T Cells (2.9%), and increase of the TCR γ/δ T cells (24.7%). Transitional B cells (0.4%), and terminal differentiated B cell subsets (0.06%) were reduced, while Switched Memory B cells (34.2%) were increased. T-cell Receptor Excision Circles (TRECs) and Kappa-deleting Recombination Excision Circles (KRECs) were below normal range, while analysis of the T-cell receptor repertoire showed a marked monoclonal expansion of TCRBV6 expressing cells. Increase of TCR γ/δ T cells could be related to many conditions, including infections. CD3+/CD4−/CD8− (double negative T cells) subset were in the normal range, thus ruling out the hypothesis of Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome.\nNext, we analyzed by next generation sequencing (Ion Torrent pgm, Thermo Fischer) a panel of genes that are associated with SCID or CID/lymphopenia. Genetic analysis revealed an heterozygous mutation in exon 10 of the gene encoding for adenosine deaminase (ADA, p.S291L c.561C>T), while other genes that are associated with autoimmune diseases, including LRBA and CTLA4 were negative for mutations. Sanger sequencing of ADA gene coding and non-coding flanking regions revealed the same mutation. The assessment of adenosine and deoxyadenosine nucleotides levels in the patient at the time of lymphopenia revealed a moderate increase of both metabolites: adenosine was 3.6 μMol/ml RBC (n.v. 0.8–1.6) while deoxyadenosine was 0.006 uMol/ml RBC (n.v. < 0.005), respectively. Total AXP and dAXP in RBC were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography measuring the levels of Ado and dAdo formed by treating neutralized acid extracts with alkaline phosphatase and venom phosphodiesterase ().\nAnalysis of ADA activity in red blood cells lysates, as measured by spectrophotometric analysis of the absorbance change at 265 nm (), was reduced but within the normal range (0.8 U/g Hb; n.v. 0.8–2.5) while PNP activity in red blood cells lysates was normal (200 μ/g Hb; n.v >330). Analysis of ADA activity, of total AXP and dAXP in RBC in her parents were normal; unfortunately, their genetic status has not been investigated for parental decision.\nAfter corticosteroid tapering the patient's total numbers of lymphocytes gradually increased and reached normal levels (Figure ). One year after stopping corticosteroid therapy lymphocyte count was 1.410 cells/μL, with 550 CD4+cells/uL. Thus, she interrupted the prophylactic therapy with acyclovir and cotrimoxazole.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
KIMBerly wILLIams,14,F,A-,Asthma,20-01-2020,Jessica Washington,"Miller and Perez Wood,",Medicare,37765.34817,352,Emergency,30-01-2020,Ibuprofen,Inconclusive,"A 14-year-old previously healthy girl presented 2 weeks after an uncomplicated laparoscopic appendectomy for non-perforated acute appendicitis in a regional hospital. The girl complained of gradually reducing urinary frequency to twice per day and prolonged hesitancy. The micturition stream was initially weak and slow before becoming interrupted. Straining did not produce stronger urinary stream. She had never suffered from urinary tract infections (UTIs) or constipation and opened her bowels daily.\nFollowing an episode of acute cystitis 2 months later, she completely lost her ability to void. She was put on indwelling Foley urinary catheter, and her cystitis was successfully treated with antibiotics. After every attempt to remove the urinary catheter, she had to be catheterized again with 300 to 1200 mL of urine volume registered. She noted loss of urge to urinate and felt only dull pain in suprapubic region and right iliac fossa on extreme bladder distention. The girl was kept on indwelling urethral urinary catheter and referred to a tertiary center to determine the etiology of her urinary retention.\nShe was examined with normal clinical findings and no obvious pathology on abdominal and pelvic ultrasound scan (USS). A pediatric neurologist found nothing abnormal, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine, electromyography (EMG) of the lower extremity, somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEP) of tibial nerve, electroencephalogram (EEG), and lumbar puncture were with no pathology. On USS, the gynecologist described multiple follicular cysts on ovaries bilaterally and found no pathology explaining her urinary retention.\nOur pediatric urologist performed an examination under general anesthesia including a free calibration of the urethra up to 26F followed by normal findings on cystoscopy. Videourodynamic study (VUDS) showed an asensitive and hypotonic bladder. The bladder filling had to be stopped at 360 mL due to the patient's discomfort. Maximum intravesical pressure achieved 11 cmH\n2\nO. When pulling the urodynamic catheter out of the bladder manually, the maximum urethral pressure measured was 120 cmH\n2\nO. On vesicocystourethrogram (VCUG), there was no vesicoureteral reflux, a smooth bladder wall and closed bladder neck (\n).\nPsychologic and psychiatric evaluation identified no major problem. During the following 2 years of repeated admissions to several regional and university hospitals, many of the tests described above were repeated, including an MRI of brain and spine with identical conclusions.\nClean intermittent catheterization (CIC) was recommended to the patient. However, because of poor tolerance of CIC due to frequent macroscopic hematuria and pain, a suprapubic catheter was placed. Thereafter, she suffered recurrent symptomatic afebrile UTIs caused by multi-resistant bacterial strains, e.g.,\nKlebsiella\n,\nPseudomonas\n, or\nEscherichia\n. Finally, after 2 years, based on the history, symptoms, and urodynamic findings, she was diagnosed with Fowler's syndrome (FS).\nFor the treatment of FS, the patient was indicated for S3 neurostimulation. The implantation of two Medtronic S3 neurostimulators, type Interstim II, bilaterally in the upper gluteal region was performed under general anesthesia in two phases. The first phase was a transcutaneous implantation of the electrodes into S3 foramina and their connection to externalized neurostimulators. The first procedure took 30 minutes. As the patient restored her voiding completely back to normal when switching on the neurostimulators and experienced no side effects, she could undergo the second phase 4 weeks later—permanent subcutaneous implantation of the neurostimulators (\n). The second procedure took 15 minutes under general anesthesia.\nWith a transcutaneous remote control, she was able to modify the intensity of stimulating current to avoid any discomfort (\n).

Initial symptoms consisted of full body itching, initially without a rash, rhinorrhea, congestion, or cough. A maculopapular rash evolved to cover her entire truncal region and thighs. She then developed intense bilateral distal lower extremity pain in a stocking-like distribution from feet to knee, which became exquisitely painful to light touch and ambulation. She described the pain as “sharp” and “shooting”. She then developed spontaneous tingling and numbness in both feet and hands, as well as tremors in all four extremities. She complained of burning pain across her abdomen at dermatome T10. Pain was rated at 10/10 and constant. She additionally complained of headache, diplopia, lightheadedness, and urinary retention. Before she was admitted to the hospital her pain was managed with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and gabapentin. After the trial of gabapentin failed to reduce pain it was discontinued and pregabalin was started while still an outpatient.\nA brain MRI, with and without contrast, was normal but the total spine MRI showed slight increased signal in the right dorsal cord especially at the level of T11-T12. A lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure of 46 and closing pressure of 15 cm H2O, a protein of 82, and glucose of 54 mg/dL with leukocytosis of 390 cells/μL and 17% eosinophils. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) serology was sent. The complete blood count (CBC) was normal except for an elevated white blood cell count of 11.46. X 103 cells/μL. A diagnosis of eosinophilic meningitis was made. Prednisone, 20 milligrams (mg), every eight hours was started, as were around-the-clock acetaminophen, ketorolac, and topical 5% lidocaine patches. Additionally, hydroxyzine 12.5 mg was given, as needed, for pruritus to good effect. The hydroxyzine and clonazepam given for sleep were discontinued because of excessive sedation.\nDespite the above interventions, the pain remained refractory and so the following day ketamine was started at 0.02 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) per hour, which was increased over five hours to 0.05 mg per kg per hour. Duloxetine, 20 mg, was administered at bedtime and methadone 2.5 mg every twelve hours was also added for continued pain that night. The following morning, the patient reported reduction in her pain to a numeric pain score of 6/10. Her leg pain resolved with the exception of the dorsum of her feet bilaterally; however, the burning pain persisted at approximately the T10 dermatome. Pregabalin continued to be slowly titrated upward to its maximum dose of 100 mg every eight hours. She did have one report of a vivid dream, but no hallucinations, tachycardia, hypertension, or signs of serotonergic or noradrenergic syndrome were present. On day 5 of admission, albendazole was started as per the recommendations of the Hawaii Department of Health. She had no additional side effects to the analgesic medications and her mental status remained normal. Diplopia, headache, and urinary retention resolved within four days of hospitalization. Ketamine was weaned and the patient was discharged with duloxetine, methadone, pregabalin, and prednisone with plans to be tapered by Pediatric Neurology as an outpatient. Of note, within two weeks of discharge, pregabalin and methadone weaning was initiated with recrudescence of pain despite continued administration of prednisone. The weaning was then restarted the following week at a slower rate and was better tolerated.

Prior to the onset of these symptoms, he had been immobilized for several days following a minor sports injury.\nThe adolescent had no permanent medication and no prior medical history except for an asymptomatic ATD diagnosed at the age of six by functional antithrombin assay (antithrombin activity of 57%, age adapted reference: 77–125%). Since at that time, there were no clinical signs of thrombosis, the diagnosis of ATD did not lead to any therapeutic consequences. Screening for ATD at this early age had been carried out on parental request, as his mother was diagnosed with ATD in her early adulthood. Interestingly, his mother now reported that she had very recently been diagnosed with IVCA (preexisting chromogenic test results showed an antithrombin activity of 50% for the mother, the age adjusted reference range being 80 to 130%).\nThe coexistence of other hereditary thrombophilic disorders in our patient and his mother (protein S deficiency, protein C deficiency, factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin-mutation, antiphospholipid syndrome) was ruled out by respective laboratory analyses.\nLaboratory blood analysis in the emergency department showed markedly elevated D-dimers of 25 mg/l FEU (reference: < 0.5 mg/l FEU) and of C-reactive protein (CrP) of 184 mg/l (reference < 5 mg/l). Antithrombin activity on admission was reduced to 61% (age adjusted reference 83–118%).\nA vascular ultrasound examination upon admission confirmed the clinically suspected thrombosis of the right lower extremity involving the external iliac, common and superficial femoral as well as the popliteal vein. The ultrasound examination of the left lower extremity veins did not give evidence of thromboses upon admission. The patient was treated with continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin at a therapeutical dose including several bolus administrations and antithrombin (4000 IE within the first 36 h) was substituted reaching levels in the target range between 80 and 100%. Subsequent monitoring of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) showed an insufficient response to heparin treatment (aPTT was 29 s before the administration of heparin and did not exceed a maximum value of 33.6 s during heparin treatment). The anticoagulative therapy was therefore switched to direct thrombin inhibition by argatroban at a dose of 1.5–2.0 μg/kg/min, which led to target aPTT values of 50–60s.\nDue to the elevated CrP levels and subfebrile temperatures, empirical antibiotic treatment with intravenous cefuroxim was initiated.\nA magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan on day three confirmed a complete DVT of the right lower extremity, and now additionally extended thromboses of the left lower extremity and thrombosis of both iliac vessels. Furthermore, it revealed an occlusion of the inferior vena cava (IVC) with prominent venous lumbar collaterals, suggestive of IVCA. Surrounding the lumbar vertebrae, several of these collaterals appeared to be fully thrombotic, which was confirmed by angiography (Fig. A).\nThe following day, a catheter-directed local thrombolysis using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) at a daily dose of 0.25 mg/kg was initiated in both extremities and carried out for a total of 48 h. For the right leg, an additional ultrasound-accelerated thrombolysis using the EKOS® system was performed.\nDuring hospitalization, the anticoagulative therapy was switched from argatroban to the vitamin K antagonist phenprocoumon with a target International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 2.0–2.5. Oral anticoagulation will most likely be continued lifelong due to the combination of extended multilocal thromboses with underlying ATD, as well as IVCA, which in itself is a risk factor for thrombosis.\nThe patient was discharged on day eight after hospital admission. An ultrasound examination upon discharge showed full recanalization of the femoral and iliac veins of both legs.\nDuring a routine follow-up 1 week later, the patient presented free of any clinical complaints. However, despite continued oral anticoagulation since hospital discharge, vascular ultrasound now revealed extended re-thrombosis of both the right and left pelvic axis and the right lower extremity, thus leading to a second hospital admission and re-induction of therapy with both intravenous antithrombin and catheter-directed thrombolysis.\nRecanalization of the right lower extremity and pelvic axis was subsequently achieved, whereby IVC occlusion was confirmed (Fig. B). However, the left pelvic vessels remained thrombotic even after 5 days of catheter-directed thrombolysis.\nSurprisingly, one of the angiographies allowed for location of the occluded area of the IVC by rendezvous-technique between the superior and inferior vena cava, which prior to this had been thought to be atretic (Fig. C). The vessel was successfully recanalized using balloon dilation and subsequent stenting (Fig. D).\nThroughout the clinical stay, the patient’s oral anticoagulation with phenprocoumon was intensified to a new target INR of 2.5–3.0 in order to prevent re-thrombosis.\nThe patient was discharged from hospital on day seven after admission. Regular follow-up examinations at our outpatient clinic did not give evidence for any new thrombotic events to date (time since first occurrence of thrombosis was 9 months).\nConcerning the thrombotic left iliac vessels, a follow-up angiographic intervention relying on special equipment was performed, but recanalization could not be achieved.\nFortunately, the IVC of the patient’s mother could also be recanalized by angiographic intervention.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following the injury, he was evaluated in an outside emergency department, where anterior, posterior, and lateral radiographs obtained in the emergency department demonstrated a tibial fracture consisting of two primary components (). He was placed in a cast and sought a second opinion regarding findings and management.\nUpon presentation to the clinic the following day, he reported mild pain (3/10) and noted no normal function of his leg. A physical exam was performed but was limited due to pain. Following the review of radiographic imaging, an MRI was performed, which demonstrated a type IIIB tibial tubercle avulsion fracture and complete tear of the patellar tendon from its distal attachment site, as well as a hematoma at the fracture site (). After discussing the findings with the family, the patient was scheduled to undergo open reduction internal fixation of a type IIIB fracture and repair of the patellar tendon three days following the initial injury.\nAn 8-centimeter anterior incision was made at the superior aspect of the tibial tubercle and extended distally. At the patellar tendon insertion site on the tibia, the tendon was noted to be completely avulsed from the bone cortex distally, while proximally, the tendon remained attached to the displaced tubercle. The tendon remained attached to the inferior pole of the patella. The anterior tibial plateau fragment was anatomically reduced using two fully threaded noncannulated screws (Arthrex, Naples, FL), while the tibial tubercle fragment was reduced via bicortical fixation with a 50 mm fully threaded 3.5 mm cortical screw (Arthrex, Naples, FL).\nThe distal patellar tendon was completely avulsed through two-thirds of its length. To restore the native footprint of the patellar tendon, a 4.5 mm PEEK (polyetheretherketone) corkscrew anchor (Arthrex, Naples, FL) was placed slightly lateral to the anatomic insertion site to avoid a stress riser on the anterior tibial cortex. The anatomic repair of the patellar tendon was completed with two mattress sutures and tied.\nIn addition to the avulsion of the patellar tendon and periosteum, it was noted that fascial tissue with tibialis anterior muscle belly avulsed through the injury site causing subacute extensive bleeding within the anterolateral compartments (). This scenario raised concern for impending compartment syndrome, and an anterolateral compartment release was planned.\nThree 3-centimeter incisions were made along the anterolateral aspect of the leg. The first was located 3 centimeters distal to the neck of the fibula, the second was located 10 centimeters above the distal fibula tip, and the third was located at the midpoint between the two. Under endoscopic visualization, the intramuscular septum was identified and Metzenbaum scissors were used to cut through the fascial compartment beginning in the anterior compartment and extending proximally then distally to the midtibia (). The fascial incision was extended posteriorly into the peroneal compartment and then was extended proximally and distally to the midtibia. These steps were repeated for the midpoint and distal incision sites. Distally, the course of the superficial perineal nerve was identified and the nerve itself was protected during the distal release of the anterior compartment. It was believed that the impending compartment syndrome occurred due to damage to the surrounding bony and muscular tissue. A medium Hemovac drain was placed along the length of the lateral compartment, exiting in the posterolateral proximal leg. The patient was placed in a hinged knee brace which was locked in extension. He was discharged home later that day.\nOn postoperative day number two, the patient's Hemovac drain was removed by a family member. The patient was seen 1 week postoperatively and noted moderate pain (6/10) and 0% normal function. On physical examination, incisional sites were clean, dry, and intact and a small fracture blister was noted on the posterior aspect of the knee—which was cleaned and redressed. Radiographic imaging revealed well-positioned screws, no evidence of new fractures or foreign bodies, and early evidence of callus formation. Two and a half weeks after surgery, the patient presented to the clinic for evaluation. He reported that he had no pain (0/10) and had 5% of his normal function at this time. On physical examination, he noted no tenderness to palpation of the knee joint, and he had 40 degrees of knee flexion. Anterior-posterior and lateral X-rays were taken which showed evidence of callus formation in the bone (). At this time, it was recommended that the patient begin gentle active range of motion exercises with extension and light flexion. He was also encouraged to become full weight-bearing with the brace until its removal two months postoperatively.\nFive months postoperatively, the patient reported no pain (0/10) and possessed 95% of his normal function at this time. On physical examination, he was nontender to palpation along the joint line. There was no laxity with varus or valgus stress. He demonstrated 5/5 quadriceps strength with no evidence of an extensor lag. He had an active range of motion from 0 to 130 degrees of flexion, and there was no lag with straight leg raise. Repeat anterior-posterior and lateral X-rays demonstrated a well-reduced tibial tubercle fracture as well as well-positioned and nondisplaced hardware ().",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Her cardiovascular symptoms started one month before the presentation with a history of recurrent episodes of shortness of breath, palpitations, and chest pain. The severity of the symptoms has increased in the past few weeks. At the time of referral, she was on furosemide 10 mg twice daily and enalapril 10 mg once daily. Her parents are phenotypically normal. All her siblings, five brothers and two sisters, are free from the disorder. Also, the patient has a remarkable family history, as her cousin is a 20-year-old male with the same disorder. There is consanguinity between parents in the family. On general examination, she had a senile appearance with generalized inelastic, loose, and sagging skin. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 114 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 123/73 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100% in room air, and temperature of 36 °C. On cardiac examination, the precordium was hyperactive, the first and second heart sounds were obscured, and pansystolic murmur grade III/VI radiating to the axilla was detected. The hematological studies were within normal limits. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia with right atrial enlargement and right ventricular hypertrophy (Figure ). Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with subsegmental atelectasis (Figure ). For more assessment and operative plan, transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed severe mitral and tricuspid valve prolapse with malcoaptation causing severe regurgitation of both valves with pulmonary hypertension and severe dilatation of both right and left atria (Figures -). After the patient’s condition was discussed in the heart team meeting, the plan was set for mitral and tricuspid valve repair versus replacement, depending on the intraoperative findings. Also, the patient was planned to be counseled by a medical geneticist. The case was discussed with the patient and her family as they were involved in the clinical decision.\nProcedure\nUnder general anesthesia, midline sternotomy was carried out, and the thymus was resected due to its enormous size. Standard cannulation was accomplished through the ascending aorta and superior and inferior vena cava with snugging around each cannula. Consequently, standard cardioplegic arrest with full flow of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was achieved as the patient was cooled down to a temperature of 30 °C. The aortic valve was immediately examined after the aorta was transversely opened, and it had some significant enlargement and dilatation of the leaflet, but the valve was manually competent; thence, no intervention was done to the aortic valve. Both atria were significantly enlarged; thereupon, right and left atrial appendages were resected in combination with atrioplasty (Figures , ). The left atrium was opened, the mitral valve was examined and showed significant myxomatous changes of both anterior and posterior leaflets, and the valve was irreparable. Hence, the decision was made intraoperatively to replace the mitral valve with a 33-mm St. Jude Medical Epic porcine valve prosthesis (Figure ). After this, through an incision into the right atrium, the tricuspid valve was found to have a cleft at the septal leaflet and the anterior leaflet with significant dilation of the annulus. Accordingly, commissural tricuspid annuloplasty was performed. The tricuspid valve test rendered a competent valve. After completing the procedure, the patient was fully rewarmed and weaned off CPB. Intraoperative TEE showed trace tricuspid regurgitation, and the prosthetic valve was well seated at the mitral position. With these findings, the patient was decannulated, chest tubes and pacer wire were inserted, and closure was performed. She was transferred to the cardiac surgery intensive care unit (CSICU) in a stable condition. During the first 15 hours in the CSICU, the chest tubes drained blood in a total of 1,450 mL (right lower pleura), 300 mL (mediastinum), and 1,330 mL (left lower pleura). Afterward, the patient received five units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), seven units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), two units of cryoprecipitated antihemophilic factor (Cryo), two units of platelets, and two doses of intravenous protamine sulfate (50 mg per dose).

The patient described constant back pain almost daily for which she took ibuprofen with moderate relief. These symptoms began three years ago following a sexual assault and have progressed significantly. As per the patient's mother, the only time the patient's spine straightened out was during deep sleep. She had no neurologic complaints, specifically denying any sensory or motor deficits, fatigue, ptosis, or any complaints consistent with any form of endocrinopathy. Her family history included siblings with epilepsy, ADHD, and mood disorders.\nThe patient denied any substance abuse, including use of alcohol or cigarettes, as well as being sexually active. She reported no history of mood or psychotic symptoms and no suicide attempts.\nDespite the pain, however, the patient was not concerned with her condition. The patient herself was not interested in physical therapy or additional diagnostic testing or counseling despite her mother's encouragement. She refused a gynecological examination due to anxiety following having been a victim of sexual assault; it was unclear the extent of counseling, if any, she received following the assault.\nThe patient was a seventh grader at a local school where she participated in extracurricular activities. She reported being well accepted by her peers. She stated having a good social support network including friends and family.

She was a high school student and did not present any symptoms at admission. She did not take any medications prior to the surgery. Her past medical, social, environmental, and family history was not appreciable. She was 147 cm tall, and her weight was 40 kg. She had a Cobb angle of 60 degrees. She had no neurological symptoms. Her temperature was 36.8 °C, her blood pressure was 118/64 mmHg, and her pulse was 92 beats per minute. Laboratory findings at admission were as follows. Her white blood cell count was 6860/μl, red blood cell count 472 × 104/μl, hemoglobin 14.3 g/dl, hematocrit 42.1%, platelets 30.8 × 104/μl, aspartate transaminase 19 IU/L, alanine transaminase 15 IU/L, total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dl, γ-glutamyl transferase 16 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 371 IU/L, total protein 8.2 g/dl, albumin 5.2 g/dl, blood urea nitrogen 11 mg/dl, creatinine 0.39 mg/dl, sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.5 mEq/L, chloride 102 mEq/L, C-reactive protein 0.01 mg/dl, urinalysis pH 6.0, no uric protein, no urinary sugar, no ketone body, and no uric blood. No microbial examination was performed.\nWe planned general anesthesia using a target-controlled infusion of propofol and a continuous infusion of remifentanil to record MEPs and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs). In addition, we planned to use both bolus and continuous infusions of ketamine, followed by intravenous patient-controlled fentanyl as postoperative analgesia because we believed that ketamine did not affect MEP monitoring.\nAfter securing an intravenous line in the patient’s forearm, general anesthesia was induced using a target-controlled infusion of propofol 4 μg/ml and remifentanil 0.3 μg/kg/minute. After administration of rocuronium 20 mg, the trachea was intubated using a reinforced endotracheal tube. Thereafter, 1 g of cefazolin sodium was administered intravenously every 3 hours during the surgery and every 12 hours until postoperative day 1.\nWe started preparation for recording the MEPs and SSEPs. MEPs were evoked by transcranial electrical stimulation (a train of five pulses with an interstimulus interval of 2 milliseconds; supramaximal stimulus, 400 V) with screw electrodes fixed at 2 cm anterior to C3 and C4 (cathode and anode, respectively, following the international 10–20 system). MEPs and SSEPs were recorded using an intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring system (Neuromaster MEE-1216; Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan). MEPs were recorded bilaterally from the abductor pollicis, quadriceps femoris, tibialis anterior, and flexor hallucis brevis muscles. SSEPs were evoked by stimulation (30 mA) of the sciatic nerve and recorded from 2 cm posterior to Cz (averaging the signals generated by 200 stimulations).\nAfter the patient was turned to a prone position, we confirmed that we could record MEPs from all targeted muscles without difficulty. We maintained general anesthesia using a target-controlled infusion of propofol 3.3 μg/ml and remifentanil 0.2 μg/kg/minute. The patient’s bispectral index values were below 60, and her vital signs were stable. Several minutes before the skin incision was made, the attending anesthesiologist evaluating the MEPs discovered that they were markedly attenuated (Fig. ). The attending anesthesiologist had not changed the propofol infusion rate and had not administered any other drugs except for intravenous bolus administration of ketamine 50 mg (1.25 mg/kg). Ketamine was administered about 3 minutes before the change in MEP waveforms. The patient’s blood pressure, heart rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, end-tidal CO2, and body temperature remained stable. The surgery had not started at that time. About 6 minutes after administration of ketamine, the MEP amplitudes were recovered.\nThe surgery was performed uneventfully, and the patient had no neurologic deficit when she emerged from general anesthesia. Intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (a combination of fentanyl 25 μg/ml and ketamine 2.5 mg/ml, background infusion 1 ml/hour, bolus 1 ml, and lockout time 10 minutes) was used for postoperative pain management. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 11 without any complications.

ELIzaBEtH MoRRis,15,F,O+,Cancer,07-04-2020,Trevor Novak,"Mcmahon Cook Johns, and",Blue Cross,30467.37164,455,Elective,05-05-2020,Penicillin,Normal,"Patient A presented as a mostly healthy 15-year-old Caucasian female with some developmental disabilities and ADHD, characterized by poor attention span, poor attention to details, poor organization, forgetfulness, excessive talking, impulsivity, and distractibility since age seven. Her father reported two severe brain injuries around the age of five. Over the course of one year at age 15, she required four inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations and numerous outpatient and medication management appointments due to an acute onset of “seizure-like” spells, psychotic thinking, and seemingly schizophrenic symptoms, manifesting as auditory hallucinations (AH) and catatonic movements. The differential diagnosis included schizophrenia, severe Tourette syndrome, Major Depressive Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.\nOver time, Patient A had several strange physical symptoms including dysphonia, mouth twitches, echolalia, frequent pacing, frequent cussing, holding her breath, repeatedly asking the same questions, crying and laughing for no reason, staring, outstretching of her arms for 30 minutes, stumbling, worsening dysgraphia, unable to solve math problem, and worsening reading skills.\nInitially, the change in her behavior was thought to be a neurologic issue due to the “seizure-like” spells, characterized by uncontrollable mouth twitching, eye rolling, and staring into space. However, after an unrevealing neurology evaluation she was referred to psychiatry. Mood and anxiety disorders were also suspected due to fears of social situations, making mistakes, and trying new things in conjunction with irritability, muscle tension, insomnia, self-consciousness, stomachaches, and feelings of worthlessness resulting in self-blame.\nAfter a few months of declining mental health, patient A began outpatient psychotherapy sessions, where she discussed issues with being bullied and social anxiety at school. During these sessions, patient A's professional clinical counselor (LPCC) consistently noted she was zoning out, mouthing words silently, seemingly in response to internal stimuli, and exhibiting unilateral catatonic right arm movements.\nDue to the lack of outpatient success, patient A was admitted to a partial hospitalization program (PHP). There, she displayed symptoms of mouthing words and laughing as a response to internal stimuli, outbursts of cussing at friends not present, leaving food in mouth for hours before swallowing, and deterioration of handwriting. Due to the severity of symptoms, patient A was admitted to an inpatient psychiatry unit, where she was diagnosed with a psychotic disorder. Interestingly, she had experienced a Streptococcus infection one month prior to this first admission. While on the inpatient unit for eight days, risperidone 0.25 mg BID was started and sequentially increased to 0.5 mg QAM and 1.0 mg QPM, which caused enough improvement for patient A to return to the PHP. All neuroleptic trials for this patient lasted for about six to eight weeks.\nThe prevalence of her auditory hallucinations (AH's) increased in quantity and severity while in the PHP, so she was admitted a second time to inpatient psychiatry, where she began treatment for psychosis and schizophrenia. During this admission, she admitted that some of the voices in her head were her own and another voice was a male bully from school telling patient A to kill herself, raising questions as to whether these were actual AHs or flashbacks from past traumatic experiences.\nUnfortunately, patient A continued to have difficulty with chewing and swallowing food, which led to gagging, choking, and emesis, as well as echolalia, restlessness, inappropriate smiling, and irregular arm movements. Her medication regimen was further altered to include benztropine 0.5 mg BID, ziprasidone 20 mg BID, and trazodone 25-50 mg at night for sleep. On this medication regimen, patient A showed improvement for the first few days before the AHs and other symptoms began to once again hinder her daily function.\nAfter almost two weeks of crisis stabilization, patient A was discharged and sent back to the PHP, where thought blocking, flat affect, responding to internal stimuli, anxiety, and jerking movements persisted. She then began having self-harm and suicidal thoughts. Ziprasidone was increased to 40 mg QAM and 80 mg QPM with the goal of relieving the AHs while minimizing psychotic and seemingly schizophrenic symptoms. Propranolol 10 mg was introduced as needed for agitation. After little improvement, she was admitted to inpatient for a third time for a higher level of care.\nDuring this hospitalization, ziprasidone was cross-tapered with aripriprazole with little benefit. Aripriprazole was then cross-tapered with lurasidone up to a dose of 40 mg QAM. Benztropine was increased to 0.75 mg BID and lorazepam to 0.25 mg BID and 0.5 mg QHS was also started. The as needed trazodone and propranolol were discontinued. With this regimen, AHs were only reported every other day, and activities of daily living (ADL) were able to be completed with less anxiety and prompting from staff, allowing her to be discharged from her third inpatient hospitalization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
KeRRi mEJiA,15,F,O+,Obesity,28-01-2024,Mrs. Katherine Moore,Bowers-Hawkins,UnitedHealthcare,37483.32159,306,Urgent,09-02-2024,Paracetamol,Inconclusive,"A 15-year-old female was returning for follow-up after a 1-month medroxyprogesterone acetate challenge test. The patient had been seen at the clinic prior to age 10 and returned at age 14, reporting menarche at age 14. The patient returned at age 15 and reported that menstruation had started and stopped twice. Free testosterone was high (6.8 pg/mL), and polycystic ovary syndrome was suspected. This patient history may have deterred clinicians from initially including a differential diagnosis of MRKH. The patient was given the medroxyprogesterone acetate challenge test for suspected secondary amenorrhea and returned for follow-up, after 1 month. The patient had not menstruated after the medroxyprogesterone challenge test.\nIn a detailed sexual history, the patient reported being sexually active, including vaginal penetration and excluding anal penetration. At this visit, the patient reported continued amenorrhea, lower abdominal pain, and frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs).\nUpon attempted collection of a genital swab specimen for sexually transmitted disease (STD) testing, labia minora and majora were present, but no opening to the vagina could be identified, such that the genital swab could not penetrate beyond a wall of pale pink, thin tissue, immediately past labia minora. Further physical examination of the genital tract, or insertion of a speculum, was not possible due to this abnormality. There were no masses in the abdomen, and urethral and rectal openings were intact and fully developed. Ultrasound confirmed the lack of a vaginal canal, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the presence of a remnant uterus, consistent with a diagnosis of MRKH. The MRI also screened for possible concomitant defects.\nMRI results confirmed a suspected diagnosis of MRKH with uterine aplasia. In the presumed location of the uterus, there was a longitudinal soft tissue plate measuring 2.5 × 1.4 centimeters. There was also no direct communication to the vulvar region. Bilateral ovaries were identified and demonstrated developed follicles. The presumed location of the vaginal canal was visualized with fluid and debris inside, which may have resulted from a lack of an opening to the vulva. MRI also revealed a mildly asymmetric and dysmorphic sacrum and L5 vertebral body.\nBilateral kidneys were present in the expected location. The left renal collecting system was duplicated, with mild hydronephrosis and hydroureter, extending to the level of the left common iliac artery. Both ureters on the left side were mildly dilated, down to the crossing of the iliac artery. More distally, the caliber of duplicate ureters was within normal limits. The right kidney was unremarkable but with a slightly prominent ureter.\nThe patient had noted hearing loss. A pure tone audiometry test demonstrated conductive hearing loss at low frequencies, in the right ear. However, auditory brainstem response testing of the inner ear (cochlea) and brain pathways for hearing were within normal limits.\nThe patient had a history of psychiatric diagnoses and was receiving pharmacological treatment (clonidine and methylphenidate) and counseling. Socioeconomic and familial challenges likely contributed to development and exacerbation of psychiatric and behavioral issues. In addition to facing poverty, the patient's mother was deaf and partially blind, and the patient served as caretaker.\nWhen the diagnosis of MRKH was delivered and explained to the patient and her mother, the patient reported regular bladder and bowel function and continued amenorrhea. The patient also reported suicidal ideation, but reported major improvements in quality of life after taking residence in a behavioral health rehabilitation facility and maintaining regular psychiatric appointments and medications.\nAfter explanation of the diagnosis using charts and diagrams, the mother and patient confirmed that they understood the implications on reproduction. The patient continued to affirm that she briefly menstruated at ages 14 and 15. When asked to elaborate, the patient explicitly reported 4 months of menstruation, followed by amenorrhea, followed by 2 more months of menstruation, then amenorrhea until present, now approaching her 16th birthday. The patient was referred to an adolescent obstetrician-gynecologist for consultation for possible vaginoplasty/vaginal creation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She had normal growth and development with menarche at 11 years of age. At the time of examination, she had achieved height of 5 foot 9 inches without growth hormone treatment—reportedly taller than her parents or siblings. The patient was diagnosed as having GCT of the jaw with concomitant enlargement of the mandible. Pathology confirmed giant cell lesion consistent with cherubism.\nCherubism is a rare benign condition characterized by bilateral expansion of the mandible and/or maxilla that becomes noticeable within the first several years of life. It becomes progressively pronounced until puberty, with gradual involution by middle age. Histologically, the lesions contain numerous multinucleated giant cells scattered throughout a fibrous tissue stroma. In some cases, lesions resolve without treatment. However, the frequency of occurrence is unknown because most cases have been surgically treated before reaching puberty. For patients with extensive lesions and risk of fracture, segmental mandibulectomy followed by reconstruction with a fibular flap has been suggested. Medical therapy including calcitonin and low-dose interferon alpha have also been used.\nThe decision was made to start denosumab 120 mg monthly because the patient had progressive lytic lesions and numbness with core biopsy revealing giant cell pathology. Further, we considered investigating genetic testing for mutations in the SH3 binding protein (SH3PB2) on chromosome 4p16.3, which causes cherubism, but did not pursue due to accessibility of the test, as well as it having little direct clinical impact on our management.\nAfter 5 months of treatment, dental imaging showed significant ossification of the giant cell defects. A second biopsy to confirm response to therapy is pending.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She had seven to eight episodes per day, each lasting for approximately two minutes with associated frothing, tongue biting, urinary and fecal incontinence, and rolling of the eyes.\nInitial assessment found the patient to be alert with a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score of 15/15, albeit irritable and anxious. Her heart rate was 100 beats per minute with a respiratory rate of 20 per minute, blood pressure of 140/100 mmHg, and a temperature of 98°F. Neurological examination revealed intact cranial nerve responses. An ophthalmological examination revealed round pupils that were equally reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular movements were normal while a fundoscopic examination revealed normal intraocular definitions. The patient was subsequently admitted for initial stabilization and subsequent workup.\nInitial laboratory investigations showed hyponatremia (126.1 mEq/L) and hypokalemia (3.08 mEq/L). Her hemoglobin was low (11.5 g/dL) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was raised (147 U/L). T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences discovered hyperintense lesions in the right frontal lobe, bilateral parietal lobes, left occipital lobe, and right temporal lobe (Figures -).\nA cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis via lumbar puncture was unremarkable except for oligoclonal bands. Serum and CSF polymerase chain reactions (PCR) and serologies for common bacterial and viral etiologies were negative. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed a background rhythm of a moderate amplitude of 8 Hz and an alpha activity with an anterior-to-posterior gradient. This background activity was intermixed with theta and delta waveforms that were more prominent in the right temporal region.\nThe patient did not provide a history that could elucidate the semblance of a previous demyelinating disease. In lieu of these findings, our patient was diagnosed with ADEM. She was subsequently started on a regimen of intravenous (IV) methylprednisone (30 mg/kg/day) and oral divalproex sodium (500 mg BID). In the ensuing days, she remained seizure-free but developed insomnia and poor appetite with a decreased oral intake. She also started complaining of generalized abdominal and bone pains, which were conservatively managed with acetaminophen as needed. An abdominal ultrasound was carried out, which showed a contracted gallbladder but no gallstones, biliary sludge, or thickening of the wall of the gallbladder.\nThe patient was discharged after eight days with a prescription for oral prednisone (2 mg/kg/day) to prevent a relapse of ADEM as well clonazepam and levetiracetam for seizure control. She remained symptom-free for the next two months. The MRI performed on a follow-up visit revealed a resolution of previously noted lesions on T2-weighted-FLAIR sequences.\nAfter two months, she presented to our outpatient setting with recurring complaints of generalized abdominal pain and proximal lower limb pain for the last two days. She also reported a new development of tea-colored urine and fatigue for the last one week. She was admitted for further workup under the suspicion of idiopathic myositis. A physical examination was negative apart from marked tenderness that was observed along the proximal half of the lower limbs. Laboratory investigations showed a creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) of 22 U/L, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 153 U/L, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of 0.99 mIU/L, C-reactive protein (CRP) of 0.3 mg/L, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 24 mm/hour. A simple urine test was performed in which the urine sample of the patient was exposed to sunlight, which showed darkening of urine (Figure ).\nUrine analysis revealed that the specimen was positive for proteins (2+), ketones (2+), bilirubin (1+), nitrite (1+), trace leukocyte esterase, and red blood cells. Urinary porphyrins and urinary porphobilinogen were ordered along with nerve conduction studies (NCS), electromyography (EMG), and MRI of the spine. The NCS, EMG, and MRI spine results were unremarkable. Total porphyrins in urine came out to be >1500 µg/L, 24-hour urine porphyrins were >1650 µg/24 hours, and urine porphobilinogen levels were 16.97 mg/24 hours. Hence, she was diagnosed with AIP and started on appropriate management.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cardiovascular and respiratory system examinations were unremarkable.\nThe laboratory examinations revealed the following results: hemoglobin 10.5 g/L, white blood cell count 8000/mm3, platelet count 216.000/mm3, total protein 5 g/L, albumin 2.7 g/L, iron 24 ng/L, iron-binding capacity 380 ng/dL, ferritin 13 ng/mL, C-reactive protein 0.6 mg/dL, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate 11 mL/h. Urinary tests and stool analysis were normal.\nAbdominal ultrasound and magnetic resonance enterography revealed mucosal thickening in the transverse and descending colon. Colonoscopy was repeated, which revealed small filiform polyps with 0.5×1.5×3 cm dimensions throughout the colon but most common in the rectosigmoid, descending, and transverse colon (). Histopathological examination revealed inflammatory polyps associated with ulcerative colitis ().

After the initial survey was performed in the emergency department, the patient was found to be haemodynamically stable. She underwent a routine whole body scan as part of our institution’s polytrauma protocol. This includes a CT scan of the head and cervical spine followed by contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis with reconstructions of the thoracic and lumbar spine. The contrast-enhanced examinations are obtained at the standard 60–70 s delay.\nThe CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated Grade 5 (AAST liver injury scoring scale) liver lacerations in the right lobe extending to the right and middle hepatic veins (), a centrally located hypodense filling defect in the suprahepatic inferior vena cava (IVC) () extending to the base of the right atrium (), a right adrenal gland haematoma, a moderate haemoperitoneum and a grade 4 right kidney injury. Additional findings noted on CT scan of the chest included multiple rib fractures, lung contusions and bilateral small pneumothorax.\nDuring the first days of admission, initial goals were to monitor and manage the early complications of severe polytrauma including respiratory or haemodynamic decompensation, bleeding and coagulopathy. Following admission, the patient required multiple transfusions including packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma and platelets. The haemoglobin trended down from 12.3 g dl−1 on day 1 to 6.5 g dl−1 on day 3 (normal: 12–15 g dl−1). She developed consumption thrombocytopenia and the platelet count decreased from 222 000 ul−1 on day 1 to 87 000 ul−1 on day 3 (normal: 150 000–450 000 ul−1). She maintained a mildly elevated INR 1.2–1.7 (normal: 0.8–1.1), a normal partial thromboplastin time 24–30.9 (normal: 23.3–38.6) and mildly elevated fibrinogen levels of 432–720 (normal: 234–500). The severity of the concomitant injuries and the patient’s haemodynamic status precluded considering therapeutic anticoagulation or more invasive interventional or surgical thrombectomy procedures at this time.\nA repeat contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis on day 3 of admission demonstrated increased haemoperitoneum, stable solid organ injuries and IVC thrombus without active bleeding. The patient’s haemodynamic status and haemoglobin levels stabilized by day 5 and prophylactic low molecular weight heparin were started. An abdominal ultrasound was performed on day 6 to evaluate the IVC and did not demonstrate an intraluminal thrombus. The patient was noted to have intermittent macroscopic haematuria, and in the absence of clinical or laboratory signs of IVC thrombus progression (back pain, chest pain, oxygen desaturation on room air, lower extremity oedema, rising liver function tests) a decision was made to hold on starting therapeutic anticoagulation. The patient remained stable and was discharged home on day 10. She had no signs or symptoms to suggest progression of thrombosis on a scheduled 4-week outpatient follow-up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient’s parents reported that tic onset had occurred when the patient was 9 years of age, when the patient began to exhibit a vocal tic (throat grunting). Motor tics developed at 11 years of age. The tics had worsened over the following three years, at which point the patient developed coprolalia. The patient presented to our movement disorders clinic with severe coprolalia and near-continuous simple and complex motor tics. The patient’s tics were noted to significantly limit his activities of daily living, including self-feeding, self-care, social interaction, and school attendance. Attempts to type were unsuccessful, resulting only in repeated hits to the keyboard interrupted by motor tics. At the time of the initial consultation, the patient had been unable to attend school for over 8 months. He ex-pressed significant feelings of isolation and previous suicidal ideation 6 months prior to consultation. The patient displayed occasional self-injurious tic behavior, including lip/tongue biting and hitting himself in the arm and/or chest. Coprolalia was suggestible and triggerable, with frequency greater than 1/min, concurrent with complex motor tics.\nMultiple attempts at medical therapy included trials of escitalopram, benztropine, clonazepam, clonidine, sertraline, haloperidol, risperidone, guanfacine, and aripiprazole, all of which failed to decrease tic frequency for more than 4 weeks, at any dose administered. Escalation rate, maximum dose, duration, and concomitant medications were adjusted carefully to ensure that the failure of medical therapy was confirmed by an adequate medication trial. After treatment with a single dose of haloperidol, the patient had an acute dystonic reaction requiring hospitalization. Dystonia at that time was diagnosed by a pediatric movement disorder specialist (TDS) based on published criteria [,]. Haloperidol treatment was discontinued, and dystonia was resolved.\nGiven his lack of response to multiple medications and the severity of symptoms pre-venting activities of daily living including education, DBS surgery was discussed with the patient and his family. Since the optimal DBS target for Tourette syndrome is not known, we recommended use of a staged procedure with implantation of test leads at multiple possible targets []. The patient and his family consulted with neurosurgery (JKC, MAL) and elected to proceed with implantation of temporary depth electrodes at 12 sites and an anticipated hospitalization for testing of approximately 4–7 days. The presurgical work-up included neuroimaging and laboratory studies, which demonstrated no abnormalities or contraindications to surgical intervention. The patient’s mental health counselor expressed no contraindications. He was off all medications at the time of testing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cough and fever progressed despite of antibiotics prescription for presumed community-acquired pneumonia a few weeks prior to admission.\nAt the time of admission, he had fever, tachycardia, respiratory distress and splenomegaly. In laboratory findings, he had pancytopenia; urine analysis and ESR was normal, blood and urine culture was negative. Gram stain of his sputum showed gram positive cocci. Acid fast bacillus was not found in sputum smear. HBsAg and Anti-HCV and Anti-HIV were negative. ANA, Anti ds-DNA, p-ANCA and c-ANCA were requested but all of them were negative. Peripheral blood smear and bone marrow aspiration were normal. Echocardiography also was normal. His chest X-ray and CT-scan of thorax showed bilateral and peripheral nodular and alveolar pattern, predominantly in lower lobes of the lung. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion were not seen (). Abdominal sonography and CT showed hepatosplenomegaly. Splenomegaly was more prominent than hepatomegaly. Para-aortic lymphadenopathy was not seen. Bronchoscopy and open lung biopsy were not performed because the patient's guardian did not permit. Two days later, we saw a few small brown nodular lesions on the left leg (). Skin excisional biopsy was taken. One day later, he developed right hemiplegia, seizure and aphasia. Brain CT scan showed a broad hypo dense area on the left temporal and basal ganglia that had little enhancement after injection of Ⅳ contrast (). At this time, the result of skin biopsy was prepared. There was severe infiltration of lymphocytes and histiocytes and atypical lymphocytes on the subcutaneous and deep parts of the derma. The main aggregation of the cells was around the vessels and nerves and appendices of the skin. The endothelial layer of the vessels had inflammation, but there was no morphologic pattern of vasculitis.

There was no previous similar history or abdominal surgery. He associated the onset of symptoms with a recent contraction of gastroenteritis within the family. There was no improvement in his condition despite his family contacts recovering.\nOn examination, he was afebrile and haemodynamically stable. There was a scaphoid abdomen with maximal tenderness in the right upper quadrant. There was significant guarding. Bowel sounds were audible. His abdominal X-ray and routine blood test results were both unremarkable, other than a raised C-reactive protein of 92.\nHis high opioid requirement, chronicity of symptoms, and examination findings prompted further evaluation with CT. This revealed right-sided abdominal mass and a layering effect at the caecal pole consistent with an intussusception. The appearance was similar to a “pseudokidney,” as shown in . There was marked free fluid within the abdominal cavity. After resuscitation, he proceeded to a laparotomy.\nA diagnostic laparotomy was performed for the inspection of abdominal contents. It confirmed radiological findings of an intussusception of the terminal ileum within the caecal pole. A hard mass was noted within the hepatic flexure region. There was a dilated terminal ileum and multiple lymph nodes noted within the mesentery.\nA right hemicolectomy was performed. Vascular pedicles were taken high for an appropriate oncological resection, given the suspicion. Primary ileocolic stapled side-to-side anastomosis was performed. The recovery was uncomplicated and the patient was discharged home three days postoperatively.\nAs shown in , the histopathology of the excised mass proved to be Burkitt's lymphoma of the terminal ileum causing ileocolic intussusception. It extensively involved the appendiceal serosa, mesentery, and omentum.\nThe tumour was an ulcerated lesion infiltrating all layers of the bowel wall. As shown in microscopically, the characteristic starry sky growth pattern was visualised, with the cells having round nuclei, finely clumped chromatin, and small basophilic nucleoli.\nA panel of immunostains was performed on bowel tumour, the regional lymph nodes, and the omentum. The tumour cells in all three sites are CD20, CD10, BCL6, and C-MYC positive (see ). The tumour has a very high proliferative index with almost 100% of the tumour expressing Ki67. BCL2, Cyclin D1, TdT, CD3, CD5, CD23, and CD30 are negative. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) detected a reciprocal t(8;14) translocation and rearrangement of the C-MYC gene. As only chromosome-specific probes were used, the presence of other abnormalities cannot be excluded. The above profile supports the original diagnosis of BL.\nThe medical literature in the PubMed and Medline/EMBASE databases was reviewed for cases of Burkitt's lymphoma-related intussusception. All publications were scrutinized that contained keywords of “intussusception” and “Burkitt lymphoma.” The literature search was limited to paediatric patients under 18 years old, and restricted to papers written in English.\nA systematic review of relevant literature was performed to ascertain variance of clinical features in primary presentations of BL-related intussusception.

Abdominal ultrasound (US) revealed a small collection on the right lobe of the liver within the hematoma. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were started, and US-guided drainage of the pleural fluid was performed. The fluid was serous without evidence of infection or bile. The patient developed a worsening ileus and abdominal tenderness a few days later. Repeat abdominal US showed an increase in the amount of free fluid in the right upper quadrant. In addition, his serum conjugated bilirubin was elevated; therefore, suspicion of an ongoing bile leak was high.

The patient stated that just prior to arrival he was playing soccer when he felt a ""pop"" just below his left knee as he was about to kick the ball. This was followed by immediate pain. The patient had been unable to bear weight on that knee ever since. In the ED, the patient reported his pain as an 8/10 in severity, worse with movement. Physical exam demonstrated an edematous left knee anteriorly. There was significant tenderness to palpation just inferior of the left patella. The patient’s knee was held in minimal flexion, without the ability to fully extend. He was neurovascularly intact throughout.\nRadiographs were obtained of the left knee, tibia, and fibula. Radiographs demonstrated a fracture of the left tibial tubercle. The visualized osseous structures were otherwise in anatomic alignment and the joint spaces were preserved. There was no significant left knee joint effusion identified.\nGiven the location of the fracture and the patient’s inability to extend at the knee, the clinician had a high suspicion for patellar tendon involvement. A POCUS exam was performed by the treating physician using high-resolution ultrasound (10-5 MHz linear array transducer). The ultrasound revealed a cortical irregularity and interruption at the left proximal tibia, consistent with a displacement of the tibial tuberosity. The patellar tendon was confirmed to still be attached to the avulsed portion (Figure ).\nThe patient was admitted and scheduled for surgery the following day to correct the left tibial avulsion fracture.

Physical examination showed an external rotation of the lower limb and an irreducible hip flexum. The patient was not able to move the hip nor bear weight. Additional examination showed no neurovascular damage.\nX-rays confirmed diagnosis of obturator hip dislocation (Figures and ). Closed hip dislocation reduction was immediately performed under general anaesthesia on an orthopaedic table. Like most hip dislocations in children, it resolved easily with gentle traction [, ]. The radiological assessment was completed with a CT scan, which showed a small impaction of the superolateral part of the femoral head (Figures and ), Pipkin classification type 1, and a small bone fragment in the obturator foramen. After the reduction, the patient was not allowed to bear weight for 6 weeks, as it is recommended for children older than 10 years [], and hip flexion over 60 degrees was forbidden.\nGadolinium contrast MRI was realised 2 months after the trauma, diagnosing an internal and middle femoral head's pillar avascular necrosis (), Steinberg classification type 1C.\nWe decided to perform a drilling of the femoral head followed by stem cell injection. Four boreholes were made from the greater trochanter up to the femoral head with a 3.2 mm drill (), in which we placed autologue stem cells from the iliaque crest. After the operation, the patient was allowed to bear weight a maximum of 5 kilograms for 6 weeks.\nOn the 6th-week postoperative X-ray, we noticed a radiolucent area on the femoral head without loss of sphericity.

Initially following the impact of another player's knee to the abdomen, the adolescent rested out of the game for half an hour before returning to play the second half. Following the game, he returned home, tolerated an afternoon meal before the gradual onset of constant, dull, severe, non-radiating, generalised abdominal pain that was not exacerbated by movement. Due to family concerns, the patient presented to our Level I Tertiary referral trauma centre by own means. He was normotensive and not tachycardic. The patient had no significant medical history. Physical examination revealed a guarded abdomen. Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) suggested a trace of free fluid in the sagittal pelvic image. The initial blood pathology was normal except for an elevation of amylase 410 units/l, lipase 771 units/l and white cell count 12.2 × 109/l. He was admitted for observation and serial clinical and FAST assessments.\nThe patient's symptoms failed to improve after 24 h observation, during which time he developed shoulder tip and central back pain. A repeat FAST 24 h post-admission again revealed possible trace free fluid in the sagittal pelvic images with new concerns regarding trace free fluid to the spleno-renal angle. A computed-tomography (CT) scan was performed with intravenous contrast. This revealed a transverse laceration through the neck of the pancreas with normal enhancement of the pancreas and no pancreatic duct dilatation () consistent with American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) Organ Injury Scale (OIS) grade IV injury. Additionally there was a small volume, low density intraperitoneal fluid, retroperitoneal stranding, omental contusion and a small linear laceration of the posterior left kidney without peri-nephric collection (AAST-OIS Grade II injury). There was no injury to the other solid organs or the duodenum.\nThe patient was kept nil by mouth with intravenous antibiotics, TPN and octreotide 100 mg three times a day via a percutaneous inserted central catheter (PICC). Ongoing central abdominal pain consistent with acute pancreatitis prompted further imaging on day 2 by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). This confirmed the CT findings and the patient was booked for ERCP the following day. At ERCP, the pancreatic duct was selectively cannulated and contrast extravasation was seen at the pancreatic neck (). A 5 cm 5Fr pigtail plastic stent was inserted across the defect and the patient remained on TPN and octreotide for 10 days. Repeat MRCP 10 days later showed a contiguous main pancreatic duct of normal calibre and appearance with no evidence of transection and improvement of the peri-pancreatic oedema. The patient was allowed to resume a low fat diet and TPN was weaned and ceased. The patient returned home on pantoprazole 40 mg daily, he was electively brought back to hospital 12 days later for ERCP and stent removal. At ERCP the pigtail stent was not seen, having likely passed out, and there was no evidence of extravasation of contrast, consistent with resolution of injury ().

Symptoms were gradual in onset, continuous and progressively increasing in intensity from moderate to severe. The pain was worse at night and was relieved by taking paracetamol (acetaminophen). It was also associated with weakness in the lower limbs, with a left-sided predominance. A week prior to presentation, the patient developed urinary retention and constipation. His birth and family histories were insignificant. Vaccination and developmental milestones were up to date. General physical exam was unremarkable. Systemic examination revealed decreased power in the lower limbs, bilaterally positive straight leg response and absent plantar reflexes.\nConsidering the presenting complaints and examination findings, the patient was admitted for further workup. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the whole spine was performed which revealed an intramedullary lesion extending from T8 to L1 vertebrae involving the conus. The maximum dimension of the lesion was 138 mm (Figure ). A decompression laminectomy for excision of space occupying lesion was performed. The resected specimen was sent for histopathological review, where the diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme was established (Figures , ).\nImmediate post-operative MRI of thoracic and lumbar spine demonstrated post-surgical changes along with hemorrhage at the site of surgery with cord edema (Figure ). MRI brain showed no metastatic disease. Post-operatively, the patient had noticeably reduced sensation and power in the lower limbs, making him bedbound. Physical rehabilitation was then instituted which improved his condition slightly to the extent that he could be mobilized using a wheelchair.\nThe case was further discussed in site-specific multidisciplinary team meeting, where the consensus was to offer adjuvant concurrent chemo-radiation (CCRT). A total radiation dose of 4500 cGy in 25 fractions at 180 cGy per fraction per day was given to the tumor bed along with concomitant temozolomide at a dose of 75 mg/m2 (Figure ). During the course of treatment, the patient was examined weekly for any treatment-related side effects. After completion of CCRT, maintenance chemotherapy with temozolomide at a dose of 150 mg/m2 was continued.\nSix weeks post CCRT, the patient was reviewed in the clinic. There was clinically significant improvement in power of the lower limbs. MRI of the whole spine revealed interval development of cystic degeneration with peripheral enhancement in the irradiated area along with cord expansion and edema (Figure ). Maintenance chemotherapy with temozolomide was continued and he was advised to follow in the clinic after three months along with a repeat MRI of the craniospinal axis.\nOn the subsequent follow-up, the patient complained of headache and pain in lower back. On examination, there was a substantial decline of power in the lower limbs. MRI showed interval development of two new rounded lesions at L2-L3 vertebral levels which were suggestive of disease progression (Figure ).

He was treated with topical antibiotics in addition to steroid and lubricant eye drops. He was administered LAmB at SKKRC after recovery from eye complications. On 6 month after treatment follow up, his skin qPCR for LD-DNA was negative and there was no further ophthalmic complaints.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These symptoms were associated with significant appetite and weight loss but there was no history of fever, jaundice, melena, hematemesis, hemoptysis, cough, chest pain, or shortness of breath. There was no history of similar illness or other malignancy in his family. He was not on any medication.\nOn examination he was conscious and oriented. He had a thin build and pallor. He was afebrile. His pulse rate was 84/minute and blood pressure (BP) was 110/74 mmHg. His abdomen was distended with no local bulge. On digital rectal examination, a circumferential proliferative growth was felt 1 cm above the anal verge, which was almost completely occluding the lumen. On scrotal examination, a small nodule was felt in his right testis. The rest of the systemic examination was normal.\nAn abdominal and chest X-ray was done as preliminary investigation which revealed signs of intestinal obstruction (Fig. ).\nIn view of intestinal obstruction, he was taken into our emergency operation theater and a diverting loop sigmoid colostomy was performed. His symptoms were relieved, and stoma was well functioning and healthy.\nA punch biopsy was taken from anorectal growth. The histopathological examination (HPE) report suggested signet ring cell adenocarcinoma of rectum (Fig. ). Tumor markers report showed: carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) 499.93, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) 2.42, beta human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) < 1.2, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 593.\nRoutine investigations including complete blood count (CBC), and liver and renal function tests were within normal limits. His urine analysis was also normal.\nContrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of his chest, abdomen, pelvis, and brain was done as a part of metastatic workup which showed diffuse circumferential homogenous thickening involving rectum approximately 1 cm from the anal verge and extending into sigmoid colon proximally up to colostomy site. Multiple enlarged lymph nodes, some showing necrosis, were noted in perirectal, iliac, bilateral para-aortic, periportal, and celiac regions. Moreover, multiple enlarged lymph nodes were seen in the mediastinum in bilateral paratracheal, prevascular, and subcarinal regions, and in left supraclavicular region. In addition, hepatomegaly with liver measuring 17.8 cm was present. However, no lesion was seen in liver parenchyma. There was mild left-sided pleural effusion (Figs. and ). There was no lesion in his brain suggestive of metastasis. His right testis was enlarged. Ultrasonography (USG) showed a hypoechoic nodule (Fig. ) in his right testis from which a fine-needle aspiration biopsy was done, which revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma (Fig. ).\nIn view of distant metastasis, we planned to give our patient neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, within 2 weeks of surgery he developed progressive respiratory distress. A chest X-ray showed infiltrations and bilateral pleural effusion. He was intubated and was kept in our intensive care unit (ICU). However, his condition deteriorated and he developed multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in the next few days. Eventually he died with multiple organ failure. An autopsy was not performed as per the wish of his family members. The entire course of illness from appearance of first symptom to death was only 2 months.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the initial examination, the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/100 for the right eye and 20/16 for the left eye. No abnormalities were observed in intraocular pressure or in the anterior ocular segment findings. A fundus examination of the right eye revealed exudative retinal detachment with subretinal haemorrhage and orange-red lesion (arrow, Fig. ) from the upper intermediate periphery to the posterior pole (Fig. ). Fluorescein angiography (Heidelberg Retina Angiography; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) revealed fluorescence leakage from the orange-red lesion (arrows, Fig. ). Abnormal telangiectatic vessels and microaneurysms were found at the nasal peripheral retina (arrowheads, Fig. ). Using B-mode ultrasonography, we observed elevation of the retina due to the haemorrhagic exudative retinal detachment, but no features of solid tumour, such as acoustic shadow, were present (arrow, Fig. ). The fundus of the left eye had no abnormal findings. No special findings were observed in the whole-body examination. Based on these findings, we diagnosed the case as Stage 3A Coats disease.\nWith the approval of the ethics committee of Okayama University Hospital, we treated the right eye with PDT. Before performing PDT, we explained the risks and benefits of the treatment to the patient and his parents and obtained written informed consent. PDT was performed according to the standard protocol treatment regimen [–]. Briefly, 6 mg/m2 of verteporfin (Visdyne, Novartis Ophthalmics AG, Basel, Switzerland) was administered intravenously, and 15 min later a 689 nm laser (Visulas 690S; Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc) was used to irradiate the haemorrhage for 83 s. The irradiation area had a diameter of 7200 μm, which was large enough to cover the entire subretinal haemorrhage.\nExudative retinal detachment was noted before PDT (Fig. and ). At 1 month after treatment, the exudative changes had partially regressed (Fig. and ). Although the subfoveal fluid had disappeared at 1 month after treatment, the ellipsoid zone (Ez) was discontinuous and BCVA was 20/200 (Fig. ). At 10 months after PDT, both the subretinal haemorrhage and the exudative retinal detachment had disappeared completely (Fig. ). Furthermore, the Ez was partially recovered (arrows, Fig. ) and BCVA had improved to 20/20.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She was treated conservatively with antibiotics; however, she was ultimately operated on laparoscopically. In her case, COVID-19 infection presumably exacerbated the course of appendicitis and resulted in abdominal pain that was a cause for diagnostic laparoscopy and further appendectomy.

At the physical examination, she presented a history of respiratory clinical manifestations such as cough and shortness of breath. During her asthma history, she also reported two hospitalizations: the first one during a wheezing episode triggered by an airway infection and the second one during an asthmatic attack without an infection. She required treatment with short-acting β2-agonist and systemic corticosteroids during her asthma exacerbations. The patient presented positive skin prick tests to house dust mites and cat fur from the first clinical evaluation and a positive skin prick test to pollen (grass, mugwort, hazel, birch, and poplar) during the follow-up.\nShe also suffered from food allergy, i.e., to nuts, with sensitization to lipid transfer protein and profilin. At the age of 2, the patient had anaphylaxis after eating cashew and adrenaline autoinjectors were prescribed. She had skin prick tests, prick by prick tests, and blood tests for nuts, and they resulted positive not only for cashew but also for peanut, almond, hazelnut, walnut, pine nut, and pistachio, which were all excluded from the diet. Moreover, with carrots and fennels, she presented itch in her throat and dyspnea. For this reason, following the positive skin prick tests, the patient also excluded these foods from the diet. At 16 years old, the patient presented anaphylaxis twice after eating a pear and shrimps, which were then excluded from her diet.\nApart from asthma and food allergy, she did not suffer from other illnesses. The patient reported a parental history of atopic disease: her mother suffered from nickel contact allergy and her father from rhinoconjunctivitis with grass and Parietaria pollen sensitization.\nWe have evaluated all the possible differential diagnoses with asthma or additional factors, which were eventually ruled out. For example, no clinical features of chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, or gastroesophageal reflux were detected. The patient also underwent an electrocardiogram, which did not reveal any rhythm abnormalities.\nAfter the diagnosis of asthma, she attended periodic follow-up visits at our Allergy Unit, where spirometry was performed each time as well. Afterwards, at 16 years old, her asthma clinical manifestations worsened progressively, becoming severe despite treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroid, long-acting β2-agonist, and anti-leukotriene (fluticasone/salmeterol and montelukast) (). Indeed, she had frequent asthma exacerbations, especially in the evenings, about once every month, and dyspnea for minimal physical efforts while under these treatments. In addition, the patient presented a spirometry with a reversible lung obstruction. Indeed, the patient presented a basal FEV1 of 79% with a positive bronchodilatation test equal to 290 ml (+12%).\nThus, treatment with subcutaneous injections of the anti-IgE antibody omalizumab, 600 mg every 2 weeks, was started at the age of 16 years, although it was used as off-label due to her high total IgE serum concentration (2,003 kU/L). The patient's clinical condition benefitted from the treatment with omalizumab (, ), with clinical improvements after the first injection and with an improvement of the spirometry (FEV1 = 94%, with a negative bronchodilatation test) performed after the seventh injection.\nDuring the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the patient did not change her habits, including going to school, and on October 20, 2020, one of her classmates resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 from real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on a nasopharyngeal swab. Therefore, she was sent home for quarantine. Indeed, she did not suffer from clinical manifestations typical of COVID-19, nor her asthmatic signs or symptoms did worsen at the time. However, after 7 days, she performed RT-PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab, which resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2. The patient was still without clinical manifestations at the time, but after 2 days she developed diarrhea, asthenia, myalgia, epistaxis, and maximum body temperature 37.5°C treated successfully with paracetamol. At that time, the patient had been undergoing therapy with subcutaneous omalizumab every 2 weeks for about 3 months, as well as fluticasone/salmeterol and montelukast daily (). Moreover, during quarantine, omalizumab treatment was easily continued at home, and it was switched to self-administration through telephonic support and digital material available online (), such as educational videos and the Asthma Control Test. It is worth mentioning that the patient remained free of asthma clinical manifestations the whole time she was positive of SARS-CoV-2, without significant differences in asthma management during this period (). Furthermore, no drug adverse events have been recorded. Finally, she reported good self-confidence with the administration of omalizumab at home.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Orthodontic treatment was performed with classical bracket technique in order to close anterior open bite (Fig. -). At the end of the treatment, the patient requested full mouth rehabilitation. She complained first of all about aesthetics but she also reported difficulties and painful chewing. Intraoral examination revealed hypomineralized AI associated with some hypoplasia. A little open bite remained after orthodontic treatment. Teeth were small with diastemas that were not closed as requested by the practitioner. In this occlusal context dental rehabilitation may be done without teeth reduction. Treatment was discussed according to several objectives taking into account the patient’s age:Functional restoration Aesthetic restoration Lasting treatment Minimally invasive treatment\nMaster impression of the two arches was recorded with a silicone material and working cast was mounted onto a semi-adjustable articulator using a centric relation record. Composite veneers were applied on incisors and composite full crowns on all other teeth (Fig. ). Nanohybrid indirect composite (Premise Indirect System, Kerr) was used with dentin and enamel shades mimicking the clinical shade (A3 shade was used cervically, A2 in the core and A1 in the incisal edge). Each layer was polymerised. Rigorous polishing was done in order to obtain shiny surfaces (Tool kit, Kulzer). The restoration was bonded using dual cured composite resin (Variolink Esthetic, Ivoclar™ Vivadent™) taking care to separate each proximal contact with metal matrix. Carefully polishing was made especially at the gingival border with a Touati bur. The patient was very satisfied with the aesthetic appearance. She did not report any trouble with mastication. She was followed every 6 months. Oral hygiene and integrity of the restoration were scrupulously monitored. Direct composite was applied 3 years later, on the cervical part of the crown because gingival maturation occurred. She had only difficulty to control calculus deposition on the lingual part of mandibular incisors. Five years later, the restorations were still satisfactory (Fig. ).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She was found lying on a bathroom floor in her hotel. There was a history of polyuria and polydipsia for 2 weeks and 8 to 10 kg weight loss during the previous month. Her vital signs upon arrival to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) were temperature of 98.1° Fahrenheit, heart rate 110/min, respiratory rate 26/min, blood pressure 140/81 mm of Hg, and 100% oxygen saturations without supplemental oxygen. Her capillary refill time was 4-5 seconds. Her weight was 57 kg. Her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 13 in the ER, which improved to 15 upon arrival to PICU. Skin rash with infected lesions was noted in her groin. The rest of her physical examination was unremarkable.\nWorkup in the ER showed hyperglycemia of 472 mg/dL, metabolic acidosis (pH 6.75, pCO2 18.4, pO2 149, HCO3 2.5, base deficit 32.6, anion gap 23.5), ketosis (beta-hydroxybutyrate 11.41), glucosuria, and ketonuria, which were consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis. Her white cell counts were 22.3 k/L, hemoglobin 15.8 g/dL, and hematocrit 47%. The rest of her workup was unremarkable.\nThe patient received fluid resuscitation with 30 mL/kg of 0.9% normal saline (NS) and 50 mEq of sodium bicarbonate in the ER. Continuous insulin infusion was started at 0.1 unit/kg/hr. After that she was started on intravenous fluids containing 0.45% saline and 75 mEq/L of sodium bicarbonate. This was administered at 150 mL/hr, which was 1.25 times the usual daily maintenance requirement for her weight. A consultation with our PICU was obtained at this stage. No further bicarbonate boluses were given. Her fluids were changed to isotonic fluid with potassium phosphate and potassium chloride and without any bicarbonate. It was administered at the rate of 1.5 times maintenance of daily requirement for weight. She was transferred to the PICU at this stage, where she continued to exhibit severe metabolic acidosis with pH 6.97, pCO2 26.7, HCO3 6.1, and base deficit of 24.5. The DKA management was continued with close monitoring and serial laboratory evaluations.\nAfter few hours of her arrival in the PICU, the patient became disoriented and confused. She was given one time 5 ml/kg of 3% hypertonic saline (HS) due to concern for cerebral edema and she responded well. Four hours later she developed lethargy followed by apnea. She was given additional doses of 3% HS bolus (5 mL/kg) and 0.8 g/kg of 20% mannitol. The hyperosmolar therapy was effective but only transiently; the patient eventually required intubation and mechanical ventilation for recurrent apnea.\nCT head obtained at that time showed a thin, right parietal subdural hemorrhage without any evidence of edema or mass effect. Of note, CT scan was obtained after the initiation of hyperosmolar therapy.\nHyperosmolar therapy was continued afterwards with 3% HS and 20% mannitol. It was guided with close monitoring of renal function including serum sodium and serum osmolarity. The doses and other parameters were maintained per standard of care [, ].\nThe patient's serum sodium was 135 upon arrival in the ER and 143 at around 11 hrs before the initiation of hyperosmolar therapy and reached to 160 at 71 hrs when hyperosmolar therapy was discontinued. It was normalized to 143 at 131 hrs of admission. Her osmolarity was 298, 305, 335, and 299 at those timings (sodium in mmol/L and osmolarity in msom/kg). The rate of glucose reduction was < 50 mg/dl/hr.\nMRI brain obtained at 60 hrs of admission showed mild edema of the cortex and sulci and diffuse edema of the pons and midbrain with restricted diffusion in the pons consistent with central pontine myelinolysis also known as osmotic demyelination syndrome. There was no significant change in the subdural hemorrhage (Figures –). MR angiogram showed no evidence of vessel abnormality.\nThe patient required continued mechanical ventilation and further management in the PICU. She became more responsive on day 5, and her support was gradually weaned until extubation on day 7. At that time she exhibited only mild residual dysmetria, trivial ataxia, mild left sided weakness, and neglect. All deficits subsequently improved.\nHer course was complicated by an isolated focal seizure that responded to standard antiepileptic medication. She also developed bilateral upper extremity deep venous thromboses (DVT). Hematology workup showed no underlying hypercoagulability. Thus the DVT was considered as another complication of DKA [–].\nHer overall hospital length of stay was 14 days, and by the date of discharge she was able to ambulate with a walker and speak and eat without difficulty.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute abdominal symptoms were present; sudden onset of nausea, vomiting, and pelvic pain and tenderness were reported. She had a normal menstrual cycle. Direct abdominal X-ray images were normal. No other factors were present in her history. The tumor markers that were examined to determine the presence of malignancy were within normal ranges. Preoperative abdominal US was performed; Minimal pelvic fluid, an increase in the diameter of her appendix, and a large right ovary with increased diameter relatively to the left ovary were found on US examination and torsion was suspected in her right ovary. During the operation, right ovarian torsion with a hemorrhagic cyst approximately 8 cm in diameter was detected. A cystectomy was performed to protect her ovary against retorsion, and her ovary was repaired (Fig. ). The contralateral ovarian cysts were drained by aspiration. Her appendix was turgid and edematous and was evaluated as periappendicitis. In this case, as with the other four patients, an incidental appendectomy was performed. She developed no wound infections or peritonitis during the PO period and was discharged on the fifth PO day. After surgery, her ovaries were checked regularly using pelvic and Doppler imaging. In the fourth month, her affected ovary was similar in size to the contralateral ovary, and normal blood flow was observed on US. She has been followed for 1.5 years. She continues to be followed uneventfully and has regular menstrual cycles.

His disease, diagnosed at age 8 years, manifested with recurrent sinopulmonary infections, chronic molluscum contagiosum, and eczematous dermatitis. Recent complications included diagnosis of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) 4 months pre-HSCT. Treatment with rituximab (4 doses) and LMB regimen (, ) (2 cycles), including vincristine, doxorubicin, corticosteroids, methotrexate and with cumulative cyclophosphamide dose of 3300 mg/m2 as per ANHL1131, Group B (R-COPADM), was complicated by chemotherapy-associated grade III BKV-HC managed with cidofovir and 2 infusions of third-party donor-derived quadrivalent anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV), -Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), -adenovirus (ADV), and -BK virus specific T-cells (VSTs) at 5x107 cells/m2 (NCT02532452) (). VSTs were well tolerated without any infusion reaction. HC symptoms subsequently resolved while asymptomatic BK viremia persisted. Achieving a complete remission, he proceeded to HSCT with his father as the haploidentical bone marrow donor. Reduced intensity (RIC) conditioning was comprised of fludarabine 30 mg/m2 x 5 days (days -6 to -2), busulfan dosed with target area under the curve (AUC) of 3600-4000 uM.min/day x 3 days (days -4 to -2), cyclophosphamide 14.5 mg/kg x 2 days (days -6 and -5), and low-dose total body irradiation (TBI, 200 cGy) on day -1. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was comprised of post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT/Cy) on days +3 and + 4 along with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) x 30 days and tacrolimus x 6 months, both of which started on day +5 (). Mild cystitis without hematuria developed on HSCT day 0. BK viremia simultaneously increased from 588,844 copies/mL (3 days pre-HSCT) to 6,456,542 copies/mL on day +4 ().\nHis immediate post-HSCT course was complicated by gross hematuria and painful bladder spasms with PT/Cy (50 mg/kg) on days +3 and +4. Grade IV gross hematuria, managed with daily blood product transfusions, persisted alongside worsening acute kidney injury (AKI, day +14) (). Continued transfusion dependence led to significant fluid retention and 11 kg weight gain over 11 days. Daily platelet infusions were used to maintain platelet count ≥ 30 K/mcL, and platelet engraftment ≥ 50 K/mcL was not attained. Neutrophil engraftment was achieved at day +21; chimerism studies demonstrated 100% donor-derived cells without evidence of GVHD.\nProgressive hydronephrosis and hydroureter prompted Foley catheter and bilateral nephrostomy tube placement by day +30. Gross hematuria from the left nephrostomy tube occasioned left renal arteriography which revealed active bleeding unrelated to the nephrostomy at multiple sites and features suggestive of vasculitis. Coil embolization performed on two separate occasions (days +35 and +38) provided only transient stabilization. Ongoing bleeding and transfusion needs were accompanied by increasing total and direct hyperbilirubinemia (2.9 mg/dL and 2.7 mg/dL, respectively (day +43)). Complete left renal artery embolization on day +42, followed by initiation of intravenous cidofovir (), stabilized the patient for transport to receive an additional infusion of third-party VSTs (day +43) produced using the same donor as his second pre-HSCT infusion (NCT02532452). BK viremia measured 5,754,399 copies/mL at third infusion, nearly a full log increase from viral load with pre-transplant VSTs ().\nTwo days after VST infusion (day +45), onset of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was evidenced by fever, hypotension, worsening lung opacities, and bilateral pleural effusions. Inflammatory markers indicative of CRS were also elevated. CRP peaked at 268.7 mg/L on day +43 following VST infusion. Interestingly, CRP had been rising in the days leading up to VST infusion, potentially in the context of significant bleeding and interventional procedures. A rapid rise in ferritin was seen from 4,641 mcg/mL pre-VSTs (day +40) to 5,313 mcg/mL post-infusion (day +45) and 17,456 mcg/mL on day +47 (). Plasma IL-6 rose from 360 pg/mL pre-infusion (day +41) to 2,182 pg/mL on day +45 with CRS onset and prior to initiation of the IL-6R (receptor) blocker tocilizumab (). Concurrent blood, urine, and viral testing remained negative for any signs of new infection. Aggressive fluid resuscitation, bilateral chest tube placement, vasopressor support, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and 4 doses of tocilizumab (8 mg/kg) were given over 48 hours. Following fluid resuscitation for CRS, liver studies (day +47) demonstrated worsening hyperbilirubinemia. Liver ultrasound showed hepatosplenomegaly and sluggish flow through the main portal vein, raising concern for late-onset sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS)/veno-occlusive disease (VOD). Given prior life-threatening hemorrhage, defibrotide was contraindicated. Multiorgan failure and worsening coagulopathy led to hypoxic arrest on day +63. Autopsy was declined but limited postmortem single core liver, kidney, and lung biopsies demonstrated hepatic SOS/VOD with zone 3 hemorrhagic necrosis, acute renal tubular injury, and early pulmonary exudative phase diffuse alveolar damage (). Limited tissue SV40 immunostain for polyomavirus was negative at all 3 sites.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on data given by the passing eyewitness, the teenager jumped into the river to retrieve a sheep he was tending but immediately disappeared from the water surface. This youth of the same age promptly dived into the river, found the victim's body on the bottom at a depth of 2 metres, raised him, and swam to the shore, which was about 3 metres away. Based on the rescuer's statement, the drowning boy was unconscious, was not breathing, had blue lips and nail pates, and had very cold skin. Due to knowledge about First Aid acquired in high school, the rescuer started measures for basic life support (BLS (Basic Life Support)), freed the airway, performed several mouth to mouth breaths, and started chest compression. After 2-3 minutes the victim vomited, threw up water, coughed, and started breathing. In the next few minutes he regained consciousness. In the meantime, members of his family had been called and they brought the patient to our institution in a private vehicle.\nAt arrival he was somnolent, oriented, anxious, and pale, with tachypnea (number of respirations 30/min), with hypothermic-body temperature 35.1°C, shivering (whole body), and with the subjective sensation of cold. He was admitted to the JIT and the following was monitored: ECG TA, pulse, body temperature, and pulse oximetry. A nasogastric tube and a urinary catheter were placed. Auscultation of both lungs revealed weakened breathing sounds, especially in the basal and middle parts, with many early and late inspirium cracklings and low tone whistling. Cardiac action was arrhythmic accompanied by tachycardia up to 120/min, BP (blood pressure) 100/55 mmHg. There were no signs of neurological deficit or lateralization, GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale) 13/15.\nUsing transcutaneous pulse oximetry at admission we measured the following: O2 saturation, which was 80% (during the course of treatment it normalized); pH 7.32; O2 54.8 mm Hg; CO2 55 mm Hg; BE—1.60 mmol/L; C-reacting protein 96 mg/L; Er 5.11 × 1012/L; Hb 136 g/L; Le 14.3 × 109/L; glycemia 4.0 mmol/L. Chest radiography showed spotty shadows in the middle and inferior lobes with free costodiaphragmatic recess sinuses bilaterally.\nThe ECG at arrival indicated an irregular rhythm, HR (heart rate) 120/min with short-term atrial fibrillation that later corrected spontaneously into normal sinus rhythm.\nImmediately upon admission we continued reanimation. The patient was warmed up with thermal blankets. Oxygen therapy was applied using an oxygen mask with reservoir without rebreathing, at a flow rate of 8 l/min, decreasing to 6 l/min in order to maintain SpO2 ≥ 94%. Parenteral antibiotic therapy (III generation cephalosporin, aminoglycosides, and metronidazole) and parenteral rehydration were administered.\nOn the fifth day after admission the patient showed complete recovery, including withdrawal of the chest radiographic symptoms and no pathological signs were visible on physical examination of the lungs.\nHowever, during each attempt to get up, we registered atrial fibrillation or individual SVES (supraventricular extrasystole) and VES (ventricular extrasystole) triplets. On echocardiographic examination the structure of the left ventricular myocardium was hyperechogenic; echocardiography was performed with slightly restricted LVEF\nDuring halter ECG examination we registered multiple strings of VES triplets, frequency 150 per minute. An appropriate dose of Presolol was included in the therapy, with advice of strict inaction and avoidance of any kind of physical exertion.\nTwo months later the control echocardiography revealed that heart function had improved further, FS 0.34%; EF > 45%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On physical examination, two bullet entry points were evident at the right popliteal fossa and dorsal soft tissues of the distal right leg. Initial radiographs were negative for fractures or dislocation.\nComputed tomography angiography (CTA) demonstrated a retained bullet fragment within the popliteal fossa abutting the dorsal aspect of the popliteal artery. An 8 millimeter (mm) soft tissue density abutting the medial aspect of the popliteal artery was also identified, concerning for either a small pseudoaneurysm or short segment intramural hematoma. Streak artifact from the retained bullet precluded adequate assessment of this region. The peroneal artery demonstrated a 10 centimeter (cm) occlusion 2.5 cm distal to its origin but reconstituted distally at the level of the mid-tibia. The anterior and posterior tibial arteries were both normal in appearance and patent. The dorsalis pedis artery was unremarkable. There was subcutaneous emphysema throughout the deep and superficial posterior compartment of the knee and throughout the medial aspect of the leg.\nThe patient was taken to the interventional radiology suite and a right lower extremity diagnostic runoff angiogram was performed. Initial images obtained with the patient’s leg held in extension demonstrated abrupt cutoff of the popliteal artery immediately adjacent to the bullet fragment (Figure ). We then proceeded to reposition the patient’s right leg in the “frog-leg position”. A second diagnostic runoff angiogram was then performed demonstrating mild short segment narrowing of the popliteal artery immediately adjacent to the bullet fragment but with reconstitution of flow down to the level of the tibial-peroneal trunk (Figure ). The anterior and posterior tibial arteries demonstrated patency on both the extension and frog-leg positions. It was concluded that leg straightening/extension was contributing to extrinsic compression and subsequent dynamic occlusion of the popliteal artery secondary to the bullets close proximity to the vessel.\nThe patient was subsequently taken to the operating room for exploration and removal of the bullet fragment. An intraoperative angiogram was negative for popliteal artery vascular injury, and the anterior and posterior tibial arteries were both patent without evidence of injury or flow-limiting stenosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bilateral TMJ ankylosis had been induced due to trauma when the patient was 4 years old. He had undergone TMJ surgery twice, but the operations had been unsuccessful and the TMJ ankylosis relapsed ().\nThe clinical examination revealed no systemic diseases. The patient’s maximum incisal opening was 11mm. Because of the old injuries and unsuccessful operations, the mandibular deficiency had developed. The patient was experiencing sleeping disorders and mostly slept in a prone or a sitting position due to respiratory problems. The lateral and forward motions of the mandible were restricted. Based on the patient’s condition and the past surgical history, a two-step treatment was performed. First, the gap arthroplasty method was applied, and afterwards, DO was performed.\nThe gap arthroplasty surgery was followed by physiotherapy. Approximately 3 to 10 days after the surgery, the patient was put on a soft diet and began the jaw-opening exercises. Three to four weeks after the surgery, a normal diet was started. After the discharge, the patient was visited once a week to evaluate the changes.\nThe osteodistractor was installed four months later (). After the installation, since the condylar stop had been removed in this case, and there was a possibility of upward and backward shift of the proximal mandibular segment, we used a custom-made device to prevent these movements. The Sh-device has a curved metal rod and two oval stoppers that can be connected to two areas, one to the patient’s forehead and another to the upper lip (below the nose). The stoppers are made of a firm clear plastic; the inner stopper surface is covered with a layer of soft spongy tissue that provides comfort for the patient upon using the Sh-device (). The stoppers are attached to the back of the patient’s head by two elastic bands, which keep the device on the patient’s face. The elastic bands, which are attached to the orthodontic hooks on the mandibular premolars or molars, are connected to a small piece at the bottom of the lower stopper. The main pressure/traction of the Sh-device was applied on the distal mandibular segment, and the Sh-device prevented the proximal mandibular segment from moving upward and backward; therefore, the greatest displacement occurred at the distal mandibular segment. The mandible was driven forward at a rate of 0.5mm per day.\nAfter one month, we separated the Sh-device, and the mandible moved about 15 to 20mm forwards. The patient’s breathing and sleeping improved. At the 8-year follow-up, the patient’s profile was satisfactory. The patient’s maximum incisal opening increased to 38mm ().",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He had no other active complaints apart from a slight discomfort upon mastication. His past medical, family, and social history were considered non-contributory to the case.\nUpon extraoral examination, marked facial asymmetry extending from the left parasymphysis to the angle of the mandible on the left side of the face was noticed, but no ulceration or change of color of the overlying skin was observed. The submandibular lymph node of the left side was palpable (Figure ).\nAn intra-oral inspection revealed a swelling extending from tooth 32 to the ramus of the mandible (involving the retromolar area of the left side), causing a displacement of teeth 34, 35, and 37. A bicortical expansion of the mandibular plates was noticed, but there was no evidence of paresthesia.\nAn orthopantomogram of the patient showed a large unilocular radiolucency extending from the left parasymphyseal area of the mandible up to the ramus; the inferior alveolar canal was displaced toward the lower border of the angle of the mandible. Root resorption of teeth 33, 34, 35, and 37 was seen along with the residual roots of tooth 36. The margins of the lesion appeared well defined (Figure ).\nConsidering the clinical and radiographic evidence, a differential diagnosis of an odontogenic keratocystic tumor, unilocular ameloblastoma, and odontogenic myxoma was made.\nAn incisional biopsy revealed a fibro-osseous lesion and the section of the soft tissue showed fragments of fibrocollagenous tissue with a mild lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. Sections from the bony tissue showed trabeculae of lamellar and woven bone with osteoblastic rimming and intervening spindle cell stroma.\nSurgical excision of the lesion was planned two months after the biopsy. The lesion, along with spongy bone, was removed after being exposed intra-orally through the extraction site of teeth 34, 35, 36, and 37 (Figures -).\nAfter washing the cavity with normal saline, Cornoy’s solution was applied, taking special care of the inferior alveolar nerve. A bismuth iodine paraffin paste (BIPP) dressing was applied (Figure ) and the specimen was sent for histopathological evaluation to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.\nThe histopathological report concluded the presence of tissue fragments lined by stratified squamous epithelium with dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. Other fragments from the specimen revealed loose spindle-shaped cells in fibrocollagenous stroma with a myxoid appearance in some areas. Moreover, nests of odontogenic epithelium were also seen in between the fibroblastic stroma (Figure ).\nComplementing previous findings with conclusive histopathological results, a final diagnosis of central odontogenic fibroma was established. The patient was scheduled for further follow-ups; on the third-month follow-up, a significant decrease in the patients extraoral swelling was observed (Figure ).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the time of the diagnosis, he presented with a painful and progressively enlarging mass over the left ankle which restricted any weight bearing on the affected leg. A contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the lower extremities revealed a well-defined multicystic mass arising from the distal metaphyseal region of the left fibula (Figure ).\nThe mass was subjected to a core needle biopsy and subsequent histological evaluation of the biopsy specimen revealed a collection of hypercellular, spindle polygonal cells with an abundance of osteoclastic giant cells; which provided the tissue diagnosis of an osteosarcoma. Following this diagnosis, the patient presented to our clinical setting for further management. He underwent surgical excision of the tumor followed by the placement of a vascularized fibular bone graft. Following the surgery, the patient was provided with a total of 32 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin, methotrexate, and leucovorin. He subsequently went into remission. After six months, he presented again with complaints of resurfaced pain in his left leg. A bone scan was performed due to the suspicion of tumor recurrence, which revealed an intense and irregular uptake in the distal segment of the left leg; confirming the reemergence of his primary pathology. The bone scan also showed areas of bony metastasis (evidenced by multiple areas of moderate tracer uptake) in the left maxilla, left parietal bone of the skull and greater trochanter of the left femur (figure ).\nFurther assessment with a contrast-enhanced high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the lungs revealed multiple soft tissue nodules of differing sizes in both lungs. Some of these nodules were pleural-based and some showed internal cavitations (with the largest in the right upper lobe measuring 1.8 cm in diameter), which were suggestive of a metastatic disease process (Figure , Figure ).\nThe patient was subsequently started on a second-line chemotherapeutic regimen, which comprised of etoposide, ifosfamide, and mesna. One week (and two cycles) into his chemotherapy, the patient presented with complaints of shortness of breath (SOB) that particularly worsened on exertion. His predicament was accompanied by pleuritic chest pain and an intermittent, dry cough. The initial assessment revealed a blood pressure (BP) of 140/100 mmHg, heart rate (HR) of 115/minute, respiratory rate (RR) of 25/minute and temperature of 37.2 ˚C (98.96 ˚F). He was alert and well-oriented with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15/15. Examination of the chest showed a hyper-resonant percussion note, and auscultation revealed bilaterally decreased breath sounds. Further evaluation with a chest X-ray revealed bilateral pneumothoraces with medial displacement of the lung parenchyma on both sides (Figure ).\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia and an echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 60%. Chest tubes (with an underwater air seal) were inserted bilaterally. During the course of this admission, the patient received multiple chest X-rays to follow the status of his pneumothoraces. These X-rays showed a marked reduction in the volume of the left pneumothorax but only minimal improvement of the right pneumothorax. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest without contrast showed bilateral pneumothoraces with a right-sided prominence as well as numerous cystic lesions in both lung fields; with the largest in the right upper lobe (1.8 cm in diameter) (Figure ).\nA lack of improvement following a bilateral chest tube insertion incited a subsequent chemical (talc) pleurodesis, which yielded significant clinical and radiological improvement. He was later discharged with a right pigtail insertion. A follow-up chest X-ray revealed the resolution of the bilateral pneumothoraces (Figure ) and his chemotherapy was resumed.\nThe patient was readmitted to our clinical setting after one month following the resolution of his bilateral pneumothoraces; this time with a recurrent right-sided pneumothorax (Figure ).\nA second chemical (talc) pleurodesis could not be performed owing to the patient’s refusal for the procedure, while a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) was not offered because of the widespread pulmonary metastatic lesions. In this admission he was managed conservatively via a chest drain, ultimately resulting in the resolution of the pneumothorax.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient also had complaints of palpitations, fever, and weight loss for two months.\nOn physical examination; he was a malnourished and anemic male, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mm of Hg, a pulse of 103 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation on pulse-oximeter of 84%. On respiratory examination, markedly reduced air entry in the right upper zone was noticed with bilateral basal coarse crepitations. A 2-3/6 systolic ejection murmur was appreciated on cardiac examination. Other systemic examinations were unremarkable.\nA chest X-ray (PA view) was done, which showed boot-shaped heart with cavitation and fibrosis in the right upper lobe, resulting in a collapsed right upper lobe (Figure ).\nA trans-thoracic echocardiographic study revealed an enlarged and hypertrophied right ventricle, a right-to-left shunt across the large ventricular septal defect with a mild overriding of the aorta, pulmonary stenosis, valvular as well as infundibular, and a right pulmonary artery of only 8 mm. The findings were consistent with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). Sputum examination for acid-fast bacilli (AFB smear) was positive in two of three-morning sputum samples. GeneXpert MTB/RIF was also positive. Hence, the diagnosis of multi-drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis was formed.\nThe patient was started with anti-tuberculous therapy (ATT) with second-line agents, including injectable amikacin, along with oral levofloxacin, cycloserine, ethionamide, and pyrazinamide. All drugs were to be continued for 12 months; except for amikacin, which was to be stopped after eight months. All daily doses were adjusted according to the patient’s weight.\nHowever, the patient didn’t show any signs of improvements even after two weeks of ATT. A CT scan chest with contrast was then planned. It showed multiple fluffy alveolar infiltrates in both lung fields; some of which formed a tree-in-bud appearance representing an endobronchial spread. Patchy consolidation with cavitation in the right lung and middle right-sided pleural effusion with mediastinal lymphadenopathy were seen (Figure ).\nBased on the findings of CT chest, it was suspected that either tuberculosis had resulted in the endobronchial spread or there was another co-existing pathology. A bronchoscopy with culture and cytology for bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were done. Galactomannan (GM) was found in BAL fluid cytology and the culture was positive for Aspergillus species. It confirmed the presence of pulmonary aspergilloma.\nDue to the non-availability of first-line drugs for aspergilloma–voriconazole and itraconazole–in this part of the world, the patient was started with amphotericin B, 50 mg intravenous (IV) once daily for 10 days. The patient was discharged on ATT and oral fluconazole 150 mg once daily for 21 days. Upon outpatient follow-up, the patient was seen to be considerably improving by the end of one month. BAL could not be repeated for GM, as the patient didn't consent. He is still on ATT and has been referred to a tertiary cardiovascular center for surgical repairment of his congenital heart condition.\nWe report this undiagnosed case of TOF with pulmonary complications secondary to immunosuppression for physicians practicing in third-world countries where tuberculosis is still endemic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intraoperatively, the surgeon examined the right diaphragm by palpation and noted no abnormality. Postoperatively, the patient had a prolonged ventilator-dependence. His daily CXR showed right-sided diaphragmatic abnormality () but was nonspecific. We performed a dynamic ultrasound to evaluate the right diaphragm; the result suggested that the right diaphragm was paralysed, probably secondary to right phrenic nerve injury.

He also had a family history of high blood lactate levels (mother) and a history of easy fatigability. At the age of 16, he developed tachypnoea and tachycardia. Serum glucose and lactate levels were elevated to 12.5 and 9.4 mmol/L, respectively. Urine tests for glucose and ketones were positive (3+ and 2+, respectively). Arterial blood gas analysis in room air revealed elevated lactate levels (9.4 mmol/L) and low pH (7.23). His glycosylated hemoglobin A1 (HbA1c) level was 14.60%. He was diagnosed with diabetes, ketoacidosis, and generalized epilepsy. However, his high lactate levels and tachycardia persisted following treatment for hyperglycaemia, fluid resuscitation, and correction of acidosis. Several days later, his tachypnoea returned, and he also developed limb weakness and external ophthalmoplegia. After 1 week, he developed severe respiratory acidosis and respiratory failure type II, for which he required intubation and artificial ventilation. Tracheotomy was performed after several failed attempts to discontinue artificial ventilation.\nUpon admission, neurological examination revealed external ophthalmoplegia, mild limb weakness, and pyramidal signs. However, he exhibited no signs of myoclonus or cognitive abnormalities. Laboratory testing revealed an increase in plasma lactate (9.4 mmol/L, normal <2.3), pyruvate (D-3-hydroxybutyrate, 0.35 mmol/L, normal 0.03–0.30 mmol/L), and glucose (12.5 mmol/L, normal <7.0 mmol/L) levels. Fasting plasma insulin and 30 min and 2 h post-prandial insulin values were 112.54, 298.03, and 73.34 μU/mL, respectively. Creatine kinase levels were normal. Arterial blood gas analysis indicated severe respiratory acidosis. His mother also exhibited increase in resting and post-exercise blood lactate levels (2.7 and 9.7 mmol/L, respectively). Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed slight increase in intracranial pressure, normal white and red cell counts, glucose levels, and protein levels. Bacterial cultures were negative, and no abnormal cells were detected.\nElectrocardiography revealed sinus tachycardia. Normal structure and ejection fraction were observed via echocardiography. Electroencephalography revealed moderate abnormalities, without spikes or sharp waves. Electromyography revealed mild axonal damage and demyelination, as well as abnormal F waves.\nHigh-density computed tomography (CT) signals were observed in the great cerebral vein (arrow in Figure ), sagittal sinus (arrow in Figures ), torcular herophili (arrow in Figure ), and transverse sinus (arrow in Figure ). Thrombus formation had not been excluded at this stage. High-density CT signals were also observed in the cerebral falx (hollow arrow in Figure ), which was suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, results of CT angiography taken 2 days after fluid resuscitation were normal.\nAfter 1 month, T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure ) revealed areas of high signal intensity in the lateral ventricle, periaqueductal gray matter (bilateral hypothalamus and midbrain tegmentum, arrow in Figures ), and medullary tegmentum (arrow in Figure ). There were no evident lesions in the tegmentum of pons at this stage (small arrow in Figure ). After 2 months, T2-weighted MRI (Figure ) revealed hyperintensities in the bilateral thalamus (arrow and hollow arrow in Figure ), tegmental area of the midbrain (arrow in Figure ), pons (hollow arrow in Figure ), and medulla (arrow in Figure ). As shown in Figure , the thalamic lesions had increased in size and new lesions had emerged (hollow arrow in Figures ). There were no evident lesions in the cervical and thoracic spinal cord at this stage (small arrows in Figure ). After 7 months, T2-weighted MRI (Figure ) revealed hyperintensities in the bilateral thalamus (arrow in Figure ), tegmental area of the midbrain (arrow in Figure ), pons (arrow in Figure ), medulla (arrow in Figure ), and the cervical and thoracic spinal cord (new lesions, hollow arrow in Figure ). As shown in Figure , the previously identified lesions had decreased in size because of atrophy. After 8 months, T2-weighted MRI (Figure ) revealed no new developments (arrow in Figures ).\nBased on these results, the patient was treated with high-dose corticosteroids and immunoglobulin, although there was no obvious improvement in his severe respiratory insufficiency or limb weakness. Owing to the involvement of multiple systems and the patient's family history, we then suspected mitochondrial disease, following which muscle biopsy and gene detection studies were performed. Levetiracetam also substituted VPA for the treatment of epilepsy.\nThe patient experienced a gradual worsening of symptoms, developing myoclonus, ataxia, recurrent pneumonia, and hypotension. At this stage, he required sustained ventilator support and intermittent vasopressor treatment. Plasma lactate levels remained elevated. Neurological examination revealed somnolence, severe external ophthalmoplegia, severe limb weakness, myoclonus (evident in the proximal muscles of the upper extremities), ataxia, and pyramidal signs.\nTreatment with levetiracetam, L-carnitine (2.0 g), coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10, 600 mg), nicotinamide, idebenone tablets, and vitamin B was initiated after obtaining the results of the genetic study. After 19 months, his symptoms had improved dramatically, and he required only non-invasive ventilator support during sleep. However, he died of recurrent pneumonia at the age of 18.\nAfter 4 and 6 months of hospitalization, the patient underwent biopsy of the left quadriceps muscle. Serial frozen sections (thickness: 10 μm) were stained with modified Gomori trichrome (MGT), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and cytochrome C oxidase (COX), in accordance with established protocols ().\nAfter 4 months of hospitalization, muscle biopsy results revealed no remarkable mitochondrial abnormalities (including RRF) following histochemical analysis. However, 6 months after hospitalization, MGT staining of muscle biopsy specimens revealed the presence of scattered RRF (arrow in Figure ), while SDH staining revealed the presence of ragged blue fibers (arrow in Figure ). Histochemical analyses after COX staining revealed a diffuse reduction in the number of fibers (arrow in Figure ). No excess lipid or glycogen levels were noted. Mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activity was not measured.\nFollowing hospitalization, total genomic DNA was extracted from the blood and the muscle in accordance with standard procedures. Long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses were used to investigate potential rearrangements in the mtDNA, while direct sequencing of the entire mitochondrial genome was performed as previously described (). Amplified PCR products were sequenced using Big Dye Terminator v3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and were compared to the revised Cambridge reference sequence (GenBank Accession number NC_012920.1). Quantification of m.8344A>G mutation load by pyrosequencing () was performed using mutation-specific primers.\nMolecular analyses were conducted on muscle biopsy specimens from almost all of the patient's maternal relatives. Long-range PCR revealed no DNA rearrangements. Sequencing of the mitochondrial and nuclear genome in the blood and the muscle identified an m.8344A>G mutation. Quantitative pyrosequencing confirmed the presence of the m.8344A>G mutation at very high levels in the patient's blood (95%, IV:4 in Figure ) and muscle (96%).\nThe patient's mother, who had short stature and increased resting and post-exercise blood lactate levels (2.7 and 9.7 mmol/L, respectively), developed seizures at the age of 30. One of the patient's cousins developed seizures at the age of 8. Seizures are one of the most common symptoms of mitochondrial diseases. The point mutation levels of these two relatives (from blood) were 77% (III:7 in Figure ) and 87% (IV:1 in Figure ), respectively, which were relatively high. Until the time of documentation, most of the other maternal relatives carrying the same mutation had shown no evident symptoms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the last follow-up at the age of 13, the phenotype was very mild, mainly characterized by obesity (weight > 97th p), a normal height (150.5 cm, 50-75th p), hyperactivity, dysphagia, sleep disturbance, and minor dysmorphic features such as round face, bushy eyebrows, and stubby hands. Brain MRI and angiography showed an altered signal near both the capsular lenticular structures and the head of the caudate nucleus, implying the presence of a hamartoma. He was referred to our lab for Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS)-like phenotype without SMS molecular diagnosis (neither a 17p11.2 deletion nor RAI1 mutations were formerly identified).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The visual loss persisted, and the event was completely painless. Past medical history consisted only of migraine which the patient was not experiencing at the time of visual field loss. He denied any history of smoking, illicit drug use, alcohol consumption or sexually transmitted infections.\nExamination revealed a normal visual acuity of 6/6 in both eyes. A clear inferior altitudinal defect was evident when visual fields were tested to confrontation and a supra-temporal wedge of retinal pallor with associated arterial attenuation was visualized on slit lamp ophthalmoscopy. Colour retinal photography confirmed evidence of a superior branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) (ref. Fig. ) and visual field testing confirmed an inferior altitudinal field defect in the left eye (ref. Fig. ). Aspirin was commenced at this point and the patient was referred for urgent review with the local stroke team. Trans-thoracic echocardiography revealed a bicuspid aortic valve but reassuringly no vegetations that may have produced emboli. MRI and MR-angiogram of brain and neck were unremarkable. Haematological investigations revealed a moderate-severely raised homocysteine level (68.0 μmol/L, normal range 5.5–13.6 μmol/L), vitamin B12 deficiency (108 ng/L, normal range 191–663 ng/L) and a borderline folate deficiency (4.6 μg/L, normal range 4.6–18.7 μg/L). Following these findings, genetic testing was completed, revealing a C677T subtype homozygous mutation for the gene encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), a vital enzyme in homocysteine metabolism. The patient was commenced on vitamin B12 and folate replacement (with resultant normalization of homocysteine levels) and continued on aspirin. Subsequent visual field testing at two months revealed slight improvement in the visual field defect (ref. Fig. ) and no further vaso-occlusive events were noted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This patient had a longstanding history of relapsing nephrotic syndrome secondary to minimal change disease, with his most recent relapse occurring 2 weeks prior to this presentation after an attempt to wean his mycophenolate mofetil dosage. His medications on admission were furosemide 60 mg once daily by mouth, prednisone 60 mg once daily by mouth and mycophenolate mofetil 500 mg twice daily by mouth. There was no known family history of VTE or bleeding diatheses. The patient denied recent calf swelling, asymmetry in thigh circumference or leg pain. There was no history of prolonged immobilization, but the patient did report decreased oral intake throughout the week preceding his presentation, secondary to increasing flank pain and associated nausea.\nOn examination, the abdomen was soft, but the patient was tender to palpation in the left upper quadrant and left flank. Generalized oedema was noted; however, the lower extremities were symmetrical in size with no erythema or tenderness. The patient’s bloodwork showed a haemoglobin of 175 g l–1 (reference range: 131–169 g l–1), haematocrit 0.5 (reference range: 0.38–0.49), platelets 111 x 109 (reference range: 165–397 x 109) and white blood cell count 20.1 x 109 (reference range: 3.9–10.2 x 109). The patient had a normal electrolyte panel, creatinine of 100 μmol l–1 (reference range: 39–103 μmol l–1), urea 9.9 mmol l–1 (reference range: 2.5–7.1 mmol l–1) and albumin 23 mmol l–1 (reference range: 37–56 mmol l–1). His urinalysis showed 23.84 g l–1 protein, a urine protein:creatinine ratio of 1136 g mol–1 (reference range: 0–22 g mol–1), greater than 100 red blood cells hpf–1 (reference range: 0–3/hpf), 10–20 white blood cells hpf–1 (reference range: 0–5/hpf), along with the presence of hyaline and granular casts.\nThe initial imaging test ordered was a renal ultrasound to rule out renal calculus or renal vein thrombosis. The Doppler ultrasound showed asymmetric renal volumes with no evidence of hydronephrosis or post-renal obstruction. The renal vasculature, however, could not be adequately assessed. A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was then ordered, which demonstrated enlargement of the left kidney, moderate perinephric free fluid and a delayed left nephrogram []. Acute complete thrombosis was noted of the circumaortic left renal vein, with extension into the IVC, where it was non-occlusive but measured up to 12.0 cm in craniocaudal dimension []. There was significant intraperitoneal free fluid and a small left-sided pleural effusion. At this time, Paediatric Haematology and Nephrology were consulted for further management of the patient’s acute renal vein and IVC thrombosis.\nPaediatric Haematology began anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin; however, given the significant thrombus and the patient’s poor clinical status, interventional radiology was consulted to consider potential intervention. After clinical examination and review of the patient’s CT imaging, a decision was made to attempt endovascular pharmacomechanical thrombolysis and thrombectomy.\nThe patient was transferred to the angiography suite, intubated and placed under general anaesthetic. The patient's right neck and right groin were prepped and draped followed by ultrasound-assisted right internal jugular vein access. A cavogram was performed in the anteroposterior projection, demonstrating the known IVC thrombus, with tailing thrombus extending downstream to at least the level of the right renal vein [].\nFrom the neck access, an Option Elite IVC filter (Argon Medical Devices Inc., Plano, TX) was inserted in a suprarenal position above the level of the IVC thrombus [], which acted as a safeguard against potential periprocedural thromboembolic events. Hand injection venography was then performed, demonstrating no patency of the left renal vein with numerous capsular collaterals extending to venous pathways along the left lateral aspect of the spine [].\nAt this point, an Angiojet device (Boston Scientific Corporation, Marlborough, MA) was advanced into the left renal vein, at the level of the hilum. Pulse-spray tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was administered via the Angiojet device into the left renal vein thrombus as the device was slowly withdrawn back to the expected level of the left renal vein/IVC junction. The catheter was then repositioned within the IVC thrombus and the Angiojet device was advanced to the expected left renal vein/IVC junction, at which point pulse-spray tPA was again performed. The Angiojet device was subsequently repositioned in the upstream portion of the left renal vein. As expected, hand injection performed at this time demonstrated minimal patency of the left renal vein with significant persistent thrombus burden.\nAfter waiting for 20 minutes following tPA administration, aspiration thrombectomy was performed using the Angiojet device for a total of 6 minutes, divided between the left renal vein and IVC thrombus. Angiography demonstrated progressive recanalization of the left renal vein with visualization of the anterior limb of the circumaortic left renal vein and restored flow into the IVC []. Balloon angioplasty of the retroaortic limb of the left renal vein was then performed to macerate all remaining thrombus and increase the surface area of thrombus available for exposure to blood flow, which further improved patency of the left renal vein []. Pigtail angiography performed following IVC aspiration thrombectomy showed wide patency, with a large thrombus having been captured by the recently placed IVC filter []. Repeat angiogram demonstrated good flow in the left renal vein [], and as such, no further recanalization intervention was pursued.\nFinally, mechanical aspiration thrombectomy of thrombus captured by the IVC filter was performed utilizing the Penumbra aspiration system (Penumbra Inc., Alameda, CA). The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications and the patient was continued on systemic anticoagulation. The IVC filter was removed without complications 4 days post-intervention, and follow-up renal ultrasound at 6 days post-intervention showed the IVC and left renal vein to be patent without evidence of residual or recurrent thrombus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He had a history of VL seven years back and was treated with Cap. Miltefosine (50mg) twice daily for 28 days and was cured. On examination, the patient was non-febrile, non-anaemic and no hepato-splenomegaly was found. Laboratory investigations revealed he was rK39 positive and LD bodies were found under direct microscopy of skin biopsy. His qPCR for LD-DNA of skin biopsy was also positive. After confirming the diagnosis he was treated as a PKDL case with Cap. Miltefosine, (50mg), (Cap. Impavido, Endo Venturex Limited, Batch No.– 2K5312A) two capsules daily for 84 days. About one and a half month after medication he developed painful, red eye and dimness of the vision along with a white spot in the left eye. He was initially treated by village doctor and continued to take Miltefosine. As the condition worsened, he went to a local eye consultant who diagnosed him as a case of corneal ulcer and treated accordingly. Despite having no progress regarding his complication, he did not contact SKKRC and came for his scheduled follow up after completing the full dose of Miltefosine. The physician at SKKRC immediately referred him to MMCH ophthalmology department for further management. After examination, they found visual acuity 1/60, congested conjunctiva, and peripheral corneal infiltration with ulceration which extends towards the center and presence of hypopyon and was diagnosed as a case of Peripheral ulcerative Keratitis with secondary bacterial infection. Unfortunately it was too late for a recovery and doctors had to go for the evisceration of the eye with baseball implantation. He was further approached to take treatment for PKDL with LAmB but he refused to take any treatment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TIfFAnY eATon,16,M,O+,Obesity,18-07-2019,Tara Butler,"Duran Baker, and Mccullough",Aetna,18682.50519,474,Emergency,07-08-2019,Aspirin,Abnormal,"The patient was a 16 year-old Kenyan male with severe aplastic anemia resulting in transfusion dependence. He sought care in India where he was treated with horse anti-thymocyte globulin (h-ATG) and cyclosporine. The patient was unresponsive to treatment and had several hospitalizations for disease-related complications. During this time he accumulated multiple risk factors for MDRO carriage including frequent antibiotic and healthcare exposure. He was transferred to the NIH for enrollment in a research study involving a potential haplo-cord transplant, but arrived septic with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus fecium (VRE) and MDR E. coli-positive blood cultures. The source was identified as a large superinfected presacral hematoma, thought to have resulted from chronic rectal tube trauma. Given the patient's pressor requirement, severe pancytopenia and advanced debilitation, deep surgical resection of the infected hematoma was deemed impractical. The clinical strategy shifted to gaining sufficient control of the infection to enable hematopoietic reconstitution via stem cell transplant.\nExpanded susceptibility testing for the two MDR E. coli isolates from the blood showed highly resistant organisms with in vitro susceptibility to colistin/polymyxin B and tigecycline only. Borderline susceptibility to imipenem was detected in one of the two isolates. Three MDR isolates detected on peri-rectal screening (one isolate of Klebsiella pneumoniae, two isolates of E. coli) showed susceptibility to colistin/polymyxin B, tigecycline and ceftazidime-avibactim. The VRE isolate showed susceptibility to daptomycin and linezolid. Consequently, the patient was treated with an antibiotic regimen that included daptomycin, imipenem, ceftazidime-avibactim, colistin and tigecycline. This combination was formulated to accommodate the differing antibiotic sensitivities among the gram-negative isolates and to apply aggressive pressure to a large inoculum of polymicrobial MDROs poised to continue seeding the patient's bloodstream. In this setting of extensive rectal fistulization and severe immunocompromise, antifungal therapy was added empirically.\nFollowing initiation of antibiotics the patient's fever defervesced, his blood cultures cleared and his hemodynamic instability improved. However, a direct hyperbilirubinemia developed between Week 1 and Week 3 of admission, reaching a peak total bilirubin level of 26.3 mg/dl. Transaminases remained normal. No signs of cholestatic obstruction were observed by imaging. There was concern that imipenem may be contributing to cholestasis as has been reported previously for beta-lactam antibiotics, particularly carbapenems (). However, there was also concern that discontinuation of imipenem could compromise control of the patient's MDROs. The preservation of hepatic function being imperative, it was decided that the patient would be trialed on a carbapenem-sparing regimen.\nTo identify the most suitable alternative antibiotic combinations, a “real-time” HTS combinational drug screen was performed. Three MDROs were isolated from the patient on admission: one Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP11) and two Escherichia coli (Ec1A and Ec2B). These strains were tested for sensitivity to a total of 8 drugs (gentamicin, colistin, rifabutin, imipenem, ceftazidime, meropenem, tigecycline, and auranofin) in 9 unique combinations and 14 total combinations. Each sample was tested in quadruplicate, amounting to a total of 2,304 samples which were run on three 1,536-well plates using clinically-relevant drug concentrations (Figures –). None of the tested drugs was able to completely suppress the growth of all three strains as monotherapy. Notably, colistin was the only solo drug that mediated >50% inhibition of each strain. It exerted a greater inhibitory effect on Ec1A and Ec2B than KP11. The other antibiotics demonstrated negligible activity against these three strains (<20% inhibition).\nFor the three-drug combinations, #9 (gentamicin+colistin+rifabutin) successfully suppressed > 90% growth of all three strains (Figure ). #10 (colistin+imipenem+rifabutin) and #11 (meropenem+tigecycline+colistin) were less effective, inhibiting 54–90% of all three strains. In the four-drug combination tests, #12 (meropenem+tigecycline+colistin+ceftazidime) and #13 (meropenem+tigecycline+colistin+rifabutin) inhibited 22–83% of all three strains.\nNext, we studied the three-drug combination (gentamicin+colistin+rifabutin) against KP11 at various drug concentrations (Figure ). Colistin was tested as a single drug at 0.5 or 2 μg/ml. Either 1 or 4 μg/ml gentamicin was added into colistin as two-drug combinations. 0.06 μg/ml rifabutin was added into the mixture of colistin and gentamicin to form three-drug combinations. Addition of 4 μg/ml gentamicin into 2 μg/ml colistin improved growth inhibition from 29 ± 7% to 59 ± 20%. However, growth inhibition was not enhanced with addition of 1 μg/ml gentamicin, suggesting dose-dependent synergy. Addition of 0.06 μg/ml rifabutin into 4 μg/ml gentamicin and 2 μg/ml colistin further improved growth inhibition to 93 + 5%.\nVerification of the inhibitory effect of these drug combinations in an accredited clinical laboratory by traditional methods could not be performed in real-time, prior to the decision about therapy, due to time constraints. The additional testing was performed retrospectively to validate the selected drug combinations for this report. Colistin and gentamicin as single agents and in combination with each other were tested against KP11 in the broth microdilution assay recommended by the CLSI. Neither 0.25 μg/ml colistin nor 8 μg/ml gentamicin as single therapy was fully inhibitory. The combination of 0.25 μg/ml colistin and 8 μg/ml gentamicin was inhibitory in all but one of six replicates (Figure ). The significance of this finding is unclear but may be related to the poor reproducibility of colistin, which is well known to interfere with methods of MIC testing (). Additionally, a relatively low density of MDRO was inoculated in the HTS assay, while a higher density of MDRO was inoculated in the broth microdilution assay. This may contribute to the differing degree of inhibition observed for colistin between these two methods.\nInfection with MDROs in this case proved difficult to treat due to the extensive drug resistance and the potential liver toxicity. We continued colistin as the “backbone” of the antibiotic regimen based on the initial MIC data generated by conventional susceptibility tests and successful clinical microbiological control. Imipenem was discontinued and replaced with piperacillin-tazobactam plus gentamicin, the former to maintain broad spectrum coverage for the infected hematoma and the latter for synergy based on the HTS data. Rifabutin was eschewed secondary to an adverse side effect profile and problematic drug-drug interactions. Beginning 2 days after the change in antibiotic therapy and continuing over the next 3 weeks, total bilirubin levels steadily declined to 2.2 mg/dl and the MDR E. coli and K. pneumoniae remained controlled with negative blood cultures, which allowed reinstatement of the patient's aplastic anemia therapy that included eltrombopag (contraindicated with severe liver toxicity) prior to transplant. The patient subsequently received a haplo-cord transplant but died 4 months after presentation due to disseminated infection with a resistant Scopulariopsis mold. MDROs did not appear to be a source of systemic infection at the time of his death. The patient's direct hyperbilirubinemia was, in the end, ascribed to imipenem toxicity given the tight temporal correlation between increasing/decreasing bilirubin levels and imipenem exposure, as well as the lack of convincing evidence for other etiologies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fetal ultrasound showed an isolated anechoic hepatic cyst measuring 1.32/1.47 cm. The cyst was situated in the right anterior abdominal compartment between the gallbladder and the umbilical vein, and at that time it was not certain if the cyst was located in parenchyma or choledocal. Because of the position of the cyst, close to fetal abdominal wall, we suspected that it was a parenchymal cyst (Fig. ).\nColor Doppler flow imaging did not show any flow in the cystic mass and showed that it was situated to the right of the umbilical vein (Fig. ).\nA female fetus was vaginally delivered in cephalic presentation shortly after her mother was admitted.

Her previous history included a stroke 5 years ago (from which she had made a good recovery) and avascular necrosis of the right hip joint. Prior to this admission, her last transfusion had been 5 years ago.\nOn physical examination, the patient was febrile (38°C), pale, mildly jaundiced, tachypnoeic, and dyspnoeic with no lower limb edema. Her respiratory rate was 50 breaths/min, pulse rate was 124 bpm, and blood pressure was 124/64 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation (SPO2) was 65% on room air and 100% on oxygen. On chest examination, there were reduced breath sounds in the right base. She had no palpable enlargement of the liver or spleen.\nHemoglobin was 84 g/L, leukocytosis of 19.8 × 109/L, with a predominance of neutrophils (12.4 × 109/L), and platelets of 535 × 109/L (). From previous records, her steady-state hemoglobin was about 70 g/L. Urine culture revealed no bacterial growth after 24 hours; renal function tests and serum electrolytes were within the normal range (). A chest X-ray showed right-sided consolidation, bilateral mid-zone changes, and cardiomegaly. A diagnosis of ACS was made, but pneumonia and septicemia could not be excluded. The patient was placed on oxygen supplementation and was started on IV cefoperazone/sulbactam 2 g·bd, IV normal saline (NS) 3 L/24 hours, and oral ibuprofen; hydroxyurea and folic acid were continued. Pain was managed by syrup morphine 5 mg 4 hourly. Two units of packed red cells were cross-matched and transfused.\nAfter 7 days, the difficulty in breathing worsened, and the patient was transferred to a High Dependency Unit (HDU). Pleurocentesis was performed, and a yellowish frothy fluid was aspirated and taken for culture, biochemistry, and cytology. Culture revealed no bacterial growth after 72 hours, and the biochemistry results were normal (glucose 0.5 mol/l and protein 35 g/L). Cytology showed presence of neutrophils, histiocytes, and lymphocytes. The results of these tests as well as serum adenosine deaminase (22.7 IU/L) and ESR (10 mm/hr) were regarded as not compatible with pulmonary tuberculosis. Viral serology for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, and ELISA for HIV I and II were all negative. Oral co-trimoxazole was added to her therapy as a cover for possible atypical pneumonia.\nDespite improvement in the right basal consolidation on the repeat chest X-ray, the bilateral mid-zone changes were still present and there was no improvement in her clinical condition. On day 3 in the HDU, the patient's condition deteriorated: her RR was 72/min with PR of 124 b/min and SPO2 ranging between 60 and 66% on room air. The patient was prepared for manual RCE. Prior to exchange transfusion, the hemoglobin was 95 g/L () and HbS quantified by HPLC was 66.4% (), as a result of the recent blood transfusion.\nRCE was performed in two steps 20 hours apart. In the first step, a total of 500 ml of the patient's blood was replaced by 250 ml of normal saline (NS) and 250 ml of packed red cells. The patient developed a febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction which was managed by IV paracetamol 1 g. After this initial step, the Hb was 98 g/L and HbS was 57.2% (). 12 hours after the RCE, the patient was afebrile, and the SPO2 was 83–88% on room air. In the second step, 450 ml of the patient's blood was exchanged with 250 ml of NS and 200 ml of packed red cells. In total, 950 ml were replaced, corresponding to an estimated 30% of the total blood volume.\nTwelve hours after the second RCE, the hemoglobin was 92 g/L and HbS was 48.9%. The patient was afebrile, with oxygen saturation of 97–100% on room air (), RR of 28–30/min and pulse rate of 90 bpm. The patient was weaned off oxygen and 48 hours after exchange, the patient was moved back to the general ward, from where she was discharged three days later. A week later, she attended the outpatient hematology clinic, where she was found to be in good condition, with stable vital signs and a close to normal blood count. In her most recent follow-up (4 months after RCE), she is doing well and has no complaints. She is currently on folic acid 5 mg daily and hydroxyurea 500 mg daily.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical examination revealed a right fluid effusion syndrome. The posteroanterior chest roentgenogram showed a homogeneous right basal opacity that effaced the diaphragmatic cupola and merged with mediastinum; its upper limit is convex ().\nThoracic ultrasonography revealed an intrapleural cyst with a duplication of its wall suggesting a proliferative membrane without associated pleurisy ().\nThoracic CT showed a right basal-thoracic cystic formation, measuring 126 ∗ 93 ∗ 93 mm, with a discreet slope with the adjacent parenchyma; its wall was thickened and enhanced after injection of contrast product. The lung parenchyma was without anomaly with the exception of passive atelectasis adjacent to the cyst, confirming the diagnosis of a right pleural cyst type II of Gharbi classification ().\nThe blood count was normal and the ELISA and Indirect Agglutination serologies were negative. In a second stage, the research for other localizations of the hydatid cyst was negative (abdominal ultrasound, echocardiography, and cerebral CT), hence the primitive character of pleural hydatidosis in our observation. During surgery, the presence of a cystic formation in the parietal pleural was noted. The delicate dissection had objectified thickened visceral pleura. The cystectomy was successfully performed without rupture and the piece was sent to the parasitology laboratory with evidence of proliferative membrane (macroscopically) and alive scolex in the intracystic fluid (microscopically) ().",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chest pain had been worsening upon deep inspiration over the past few days. The pain was unlike what the patient had experienced previously associated with acute asthma exacerbations and was refractory to beta-agonist treatment.\nOne month prior, she had given birth to a 32-week gestation infant after an unremarkable pregnancy and delivery. Two weeks prior to this presentation, the patient had been seen in another emergency room for similar symptoms. A chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) of the chest was performed then which were read as normal.\nUpon examination in the emergency room, the patient was noted to be afebrile and on pulse oximetry was saturating at 98% on room air. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 110 beats per minute with possible left atrial enlargement and no S-T segment or T-wave abnormalities. A chest X-ray revealed a right basilar opacity and bilateral pleural effusion consistent with a diagnosis of pneumonia (). Treatment with intravenous antibiotics was initiated, and the patient was transferred to the pediatric floor.\nOn the floor, additional history of having experienced swelling of her lower limbs and joint pain in her hands was obtained. Physical examination revealed the following findings: right-sided metacarpophalangeal, wrist, elbow, and knee swelling and erythema, decreased range of motion of both knees, bilateral conjunctival erythema, bilateral nonpitting pedal edema, mild diffuse abdominal tenderness, a confluent erythematous maculopapular rash involving both upper and lower extremities, and a malar rash.\nLaboratory investigations were notable for a white blood cell count of 2.4 thousand per cubic millimeter (nl 4.8–10.8 thousand per cubic millimeter) with 84% neutrophils (nl 40–80%), 9% bands (nl 0–6%), and 6% lymphocytes (nl 15–50%), a creatinine level of 1.24 milligrams per deciliter (nl 0.3–0.8 milligrams per deciliter), hemoglobin level of 9.6 grams per deciliter (nl 10.7–17.3 grams per deciliter), an albumin level of 2.9 grams per deciliter (nl 2.7–4.8 grams per deciliter), an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 72 millimeters per hour (nl 0–20 millimeters per hour), antinuclear antibody titer of 1:2560 with a homogeneous pattern (nl < 1 :80), and an anti-double-stranded DNA antibody level of >1000 iU/ml (nl ≤ 30). Urinalysis was positive for protein of 100 milligrams per deciliter (nl negative) and white blood cells of 12–20 per high power field (nl negative). This was followed by a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio which revealed significant proteinuria (871 millligrams per gram creatinine (nl 80–200 milligrams per gram creatinine)) consistent with SLE related kidney disease. All other laboratory values including rheumatoid factor, complement studies, and coagulation studies were normal. Additionally, bilateral lower extremity venous duplex studies showed no evidence of deep vein thromboses.\nAfter approximately forty-eight hours on the pediatric floor, the diagnosis of SLE was confirmed—the antibiotics were discontinued and the patient was started on high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone. Soon after the steroids were started, the patient became hypertensive (180/114 mmHg) and bradycardic with unbearable headaches prompting transfer to the pediatric intensive care unit. Upon transfer, the patient's physical and neurologic examinations were normal except for mildly decreased air entry at the lung bases. An echocardiogram was performed which showed an ejection fraction of 55–60%, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, peak systolic pulmonary artery pressure of 45 mmHg (moderately increased), normal-sized pulmonary arteries, moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, a mildly dilated right atrium, and a less than 50% variation in respirophasic changes in the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins. The patient was started on intravenous hydralazine and oral nifedipine. A second chest X-ray was unchanged. A repeat electrocardiogram showed marked sinus bradycardia at 42 beats per minute with a prolonged QTc interval of 462 milliseconds and flipped T waves in the anterior leads. The patient was then transferred to a tertiary facility for management of her pulmonary hypertension, dysrhythmia, and further investigation and management of her nephrologic and rheumatologic disease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She seemed alert and was not pale, with blood pressure of 112/70 mmHg and a regular pulse of 78 bpm. Laboratory data showed a white blood cell count of 7530/μL, hemoglobin concentration of 11.0 g/dL, a platelet count of 249,000/μL, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase concentration of 22 IU/L, glutamic pyruvic transaminase concentration of 9 IU/L, and lactic dehydrogenase concentration of 259 IU/L.\nComputed tomography (CT) revealed a 10 × 10 × 10-cm low-density area in the patient’s mid-abdomen (Fig. ), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a large abdominal cystic lesion (Fig. ). However, the tumor position differed notably between CT and MRI, and an unfixed, mesenteric cystic lesion was suspected. Single-port laparoscopic-assisted resection was therefore performed instead of conventional laparotomy.\nA single-incision access platform and wound protector were introduced through a 1.5-cm transumbilical skin incision. Laparoscopy showed a large cyst derived from the greater omentum (Fig. ), which was moved to a position under the umbilical wound. The cyst fluid (which was serous in nature) was aspirated using a tissue adhesive (Dermabond™, Ethicon Inc., Somerville, NJ), a suction tube with negative pressure, and a 16-gage over-the-needle catheter and syringe; this reduced the size of the tumor and none of the cyst fluid was released into the abdominal cavity (Fig. ). Then, the tumor was successfully removed via the small incision (Fig. ) and was diagnosed histopathologically as a cystic lymphangioma (Fig. ).\nThe surgery was uneventful, and the postoperative recovery was normal.\nIntraperitoneal cystic tumors are rare. A large cystic tumor usually requires a large skin incision for its removal. However, if the size of the cyst can be reduced by extracting its contents, it is possible to operate via a small wound []. In the present case, an abdominal cystic tumor was successfully removed via a small incision after aspirating the cyst fluid and thereby reducing the size of the tumor. The cystic fluid was successfully aspirated without spillage using a tissue adhesive, suction tube, and 16-gage over-the-needle catheter. The abdominal laparoscopic procedure used a smaller incision than is required for conventional laparotomy, and the laparoscope allowed more detailed observation, which was useful for the operative diagnosis.\nTumors close to the body surface may be resected via a small incision without a laparoscope, but movable tumors that shift to a site distant from the body surface cannot be resected in this way. However, even in such cases, a laparoscope can confirm the lesion and be used to guide it to an appropriate position. Even tumors fixed to a site distant from the body surface can be brought to the surface using a laparoscope after removing the surrounding tumor tissue. Laparoscopy allows for the manipulation of various types of tumor.\nWhen cystic lesions can be reduced by aspirating the cyst contents, it is possible to perform a minimally invasive procedure with a small incision. However, it is crucial that none of the cyst contents leak into the peritoneal cavity. Preoperatively, our patient’s cystic tumor was predicted to be benign; therefore, surgery without lymph node dissection or extended resection was planned. However, the cyst contents may have been infected. In addition, a malignant cystic tumor could not be ruled out. Thus, care was taken to avoid any leakage of the cyst fluid into the surrounding areas. Trocar site recurrences due to bile leakage into the site of incision have been reported during cholecystectomy [].\nIn our case, surgery was performed without any leakage of cyst fluid using medical equipment that is readily available at all surgical facilities. Laparoscopic-assisted surgery should be used to resect intraperitoneal cystic lesions wherever possible. This method can be applied to various types of cases, such as gynecological abdominal cystic diseases [, ]. The procedure used for the present case was easy to perform and required no special materials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initially, at the age of 10, she first presented with dyspnea and holosystolic murmur at apex. She did not have any significant medical history, other than a first-degree relative family history of CM. Echocardiography revealed a 3.5 × 4.8-cm LA mass. The mass was mobile, heterogeneous, and protruded from atrial septum into LA, suspected for CM and causing mitral regurgitation (). The patient underwent tumor removal surgery via midline sternotomy. The pathology showed myxoid stroma with clusters of spindle cells and small blood vessels confirming the diagnosis of CM.\nA year after the surgery, at the age of 12, she presented to the emergency department with sudden abdominal and right leg pain. The abdominal examination showed left upper abdominal tenderness and guarding. There were also signs of arterial occlusion in her right leg. Echocardiogram showed multiple cardiac masses in LA (2.5 × 1.9 cm) and left ventricular (LV) (1.8 × 1.0 cm) (). A computed tomography of the abdomen and lower extremities confirmed the diagnosis of splenic infarction and femoral arterial embolism. She underwent splenectomy and embolectomy. An open heart operation revealed 5 cardiac masses (3 in LA, and 2 in LV) which all were removed. All specimens including the tissue from embolectomy were reported as a CM. The surgery was uneventful and echocardiography afterward did not show tumor residual. The repeat physical examination did not reveal signs of Carney complex.\nUnfortunately, at the age of 13, a right ventricular (RV) mass sized 1.7 × 1.6 cm was detected on the echocardiography. She was asymptomatic but with the follow-up echocardiogram showing increasing in size of the mass to 2.8 × 4.7 cm extended into RV outflow tract causing obstruction (peak RV outflow velocity of 3.8 m/s) (). After discussion, she underwent a third sternotomy for tumor resection and specimens were reported as CM. The surveillance echocardiography was performed every 6 months and at the age of 15. There were recurrent of cardiac masses in LA, LV, and RV, sized 2.4 cm, 2.1 cm, and 2.4 cm, respectively ().\nEven though CM is considered benign, due to the infrequent recurrence, fast growing, and the complications from the neoplasm including valve regurgitation and obstruction, and embolic event, the heart transplant was proposed with the fourth recurrence of CM. Other than elevated panel reactive antibody with multiple significant anti-human leukocyte antibodies, there were no other contraindications. She was on the waiting list for 11 months. She was treated with warfarin while on the waitlist without new events. Of note, at the time of heart transplant operation, she was 17 years old. The heart transplant was performed with a bicaval anastomosis. Attention was given to maximally excise the recipient cardiac tissue. The gross examination of the excision heart showed 4, 1, and 1 masses in RV, LA, and LV (). These masses showed homogenous tan white, gelatinous, rubbery cut surface. The masses were reported as CM.\nThe clinical course was uneventful. Regarding immunosuppression, she was given standard regimen of our institution for high risk patient including perioperative plasmapheresis and induction therapy with basiliximab, then maintenance regimen with a combination of cyclosporine, mycophenolate, and prednisone. Now, 6 months after the surgery, the patient is doing well with New York Heart Association functional class I. The steroid was weaned off. There was no episode of treated rejection. The physical examination and echocardiogram did not reveal signs of recurrent masses. The echo was planned in a 6-month interval.\nThe details of each episode of tumor presentation and operations are summarized in .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The temperature fluctuated between 37.7 and 38.8°C. She had no history of cough, haemoptysis or significant loss of weight. Neither a previous history of TB nor a recent exposure to TB was evident. Physical examination of the patient did not reveal any positive information as there was neither hepatosplenomegaly nor lymphadenopathy. Routine haematological investigations were found be largely within normal limits except for elevated C-reactive protein (39 mg l–1) and mildly elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase (56 Ul–1). Her haemoglobin was 11 g dl–1, with slightly reduced mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration. The investigations for various types of fevers, including Widal test for typhoid/ paratyphoid, malarial parasite, leptospira immunoglobulin M antibodies, Weil Felix test for rickettsial infection, urine test and sputum and blood culture were non-contributing. She tested negative for retrovirus infection. No significant pathology was identified on her chest radiograph. Abdominal ultrasound scan was unremarkable (). Finally, an 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scan was performed, which demonstrated multiple focal areas of abnormally high FDG uptake within the spleen (, ), which were not identifiable on CT scan images (non-contrast CT and contrast-enhanced images) (). No other focal abnormalities were detected anywhere else. MRI of the abdomen was performed for further characterization of the splenic lesions. However, MRI abdomen, including diffusion-weighted images, did not show any nodules in the spleen (). To avoid splenectomy for histopathological diagnosis, biopsy of the splenic lesions was planned, after ensuring that the coagulation profile was normal. True–cut biopsy was done by placement of a coaxial needle into one of the lesions under CT scan guidance, after carefully analysing the PET images.\nNecrotizing granulomatous lesions suggestive of TB were identified on histopathology, as described in .

She subsequently developed TSH and GnRH deficiencies. Though GHD was suspected based on height (z-score of – 3.1; see ), treatment had not been initiated based on the initial management focus being to treat her medulloblastoma. At 15 years of age when her bone age showed full skeletal maturity, her parents were informed that GH therapy could not be pursued because her linear growth was complete.\nOn presentation, the patient's height was 141.3 cm (z= -3.1) and weight was 53 kgs (36th percentile for age). Body mass index was 25.8 kg/m−2 (86th percentile for age). Surveillance labs done at the oncology clinic showed glucosuria. Further testing showed HbA1c of 9.6% and on another day her fasting glucose was 277 mg/dL. Based on these results, diabetes mellitus was diagnosed.\nWhen glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-65; Esoterix), islet-cell (Esoterix), insulin (Esoterix), and zinc transporter 8 (ARUP Laboratories) antibodies as well as DNA panel for maturity onset diabetes of youth (MODY) genes (HNF4α, GCK, IPF1, HNF1α, and HNF1β, [Athena Diagnostics]) returned all negative along with an elevated fasting C-peptide level of 3 ng/mL (normal: 0.4 - 2.1), T2DM was diagnosed. With the initiation of traditional basal/bolus insulin therapy using conventional dosing, a rapid escalation to peak total daily insulin dose of 2.9 units/kg/day (~ 155 units/day) was required to treat her refractory hyperglycemia. Treatment nonadherence was thought to be the unlikely cause of her increased insulin requirements based on the agreement between her insulin dosing and prescription refill data.\nA comprehensive evaluation for conditions associated with IR was negative. However, based on Arginine/Clonidine stimulation testing showing peak GH level of 0.8 (normal: ≥ 10 ng/mL), a diagnosis of GHD was made. GH supplementation was initiated at 0.3 mgs daily and titrated based on IGF-1 levels.\nAfter GH was started, her systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BP) which were mildly elevated between 124-136 and 77-89, respectively, became more normal. Despite this, lisinopril 5 mgs once daily was added for microalbuminuria.\nWith the diagnosis of T2DM and our patient having a significant family history of adverse cardiovascular risk factors, she was started on atorvastatin 10 mgs once daily.

She had a previous history of HSP with typical cutaneous and articular manifestations and good response to oral steroid therapy, at the age of 12. Ten months after the first HSP occurrence, she relapsed presenting the same clinical features. Renal involvement was always absent. At age 16 she developed erythema nodosum which was successfully treated with oral steroid therapy.\nOn admission to the local hospital she presented with fever, vomiting, diarrhea and epigastric pain. Symptoms had begun 5 days before and had gradually worsened. She was not under any medications and did not report any recent infection. Physical examination was unremarkable except for abdominal pain on deep palpation especially in the epigastric region, without hepatomegaly or splenomegaly; Blumberg and Murphy signs were negative. There was no skin rash at admission.\nLaboratory analysis showed slightly increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (2.3 mg/dL, normal value < 0.29 mg/dl). During hospitalization, gastrointestinal symptoms worsened despite intravenous (IV) proton pump inhibitor and empiric antibiotic treatment. Three days after admission, a few petechiae appeared on arms and feet. The patient was thus transferred to our hospital.\nOn arrival she was febrile and presented continuous projectile vomiting. Vital parameters were normal except for mild tachycardia (140 bpm). Few petechial lesions were present on forearms, hands, and insteps. Lungs and heart examination was unremarkable. The abdomen was diffusely painful and tender, especially in upper quadrants, without rebound tenderness or organomegaly. Rectal examination did not show any bleeding, anal fissures, ulcers, abscesses, fistulae or scarring. Musculoskeletal examination was also normal.\nBlood exams were unremarkable, except for mild leukocytosis (leucocytes 18,120/mm3) and elevated CRP (4.36 mg/dL). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), procalcitonin (PCT), transaminases, total and direct bilirubin, amylase, lipase, coagulation profile were within normal range. Stool culture, testing for Rotavirus and Adenovirus, Clostridium difficilis toxin and antigen were negative. Hemoccult was positive on three stools specimens. Urinalysis showed no significant abnormalities. Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), were performed in the workout for inflammatory bowel diseases and resulted negative. On the other hand, fecal calprotectin dosage was elevated (>300 mg/Kg, normal value: <50 mg/Kg). Immunological laboratory tests (IgG, IgA, IgM levels, IgG subclasses, and lymphocyte subpopulations) were normal.\nAbdomen ultrasound showed scarce peristalsis, slight ascites, hypervascularization and wall thickening of pylorus and second portion of duodenum. Plain abdomen X-ray and CT scan showed no significant abnormalities.\nFor the persistence of abdominal pain, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed, which revealed pyloric edema, multiple hyperemic and hemorrhagic lesions with round shape in the duodenal bulb and descending duodenum, some of them were ulcerating (Figures , ). Histological examination showed active but non-specific inflammation with eosinophilic component and IgA deposition (Figure ).\nOverall, clinical manifestations, the results of laboratory analysis and the macroscopic and histopathological aspects of pylorus and duodenum, prompted the diagnosis of HSP relapse with initial GI involvement.\nOn admission, the patient was started on total parenteral nutrition and IV antibiotic treatment with ceftazidime (150 mg/kg/day IV in three divided doses) and metronidazole (40 mg/kg/day IV in three divided doses).\nAfter endoscopy, high-dose IV methylprednisolone (30 mg/Kg/day) for 3 days, followed by oral steroids (prednisone 1 mg/kg/day) was started with dramatic improvement of gastrointestinal and cutaneous symptoms, which disappeared within a week. Enteral nutrition was gradually started again and she was discharged on oral prednisone.\nFour weeks later, abdomen ultrasound did not show any abnormalities. Periodic urinalysis and fecal occult blood tests were normal. Oral steroid therapy was gradually tapered in 6 weeks.\nAt 1 year follow up, the patient was asymptomatic and showed no recurrence of skin rash or gastrointestinal symptoms.\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient's parents for the publication of this case report. As the patient's age was 17 years, we also obtained her informed consent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MEgAn tAYlOr,17,F,A-,Asthma,09-10-2022,Ann Romero,Parker-Whitehead,UnitedHealthcare,35377.67375,250,Elective,14-10-2022,Penicillin,Abnormal,"A 17-year-old woman visited her local hospital because of cough on exertion and right chest pain over the previous two months, together with bloody sputum over the previous week. At the patient’s local hospital, chest X-ray depicted an abnormal shadow; therefore, she was referred to our hospital. She was in good health and had no remarkable family history. She had not been exposed to dust or illicit drugs and was not a smoker.\nUpon initial assessment, the patient seemed to be well, and her vital signs and physical examinations were normal. Serum laboratory data were normal, including tumour markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (3.7 ng/mL), carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (16.1 U/mL), sialyl Lewisx-i antigen (28 U/mL), pro-gastrin-releasing peptide (47.8 pg/mL), and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (307 U/mL). In addition, tests for autoimmune antibodies such as myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (MPO-ANCA) and proteinase 3 ANCA were negative.\nOn the day of referral to our hospital, chest X-ray demonstrated a nodule measuring 3 cm in diameter in the right middle lung field (Fig. A). At this time, contrast-enhanced thoracic computed tomography (CT) depicted an inhomogeneously enhanced nodule as large as 3 cm in diameter at the right S8/S9 (Fig. B, C). No mediastinal, hilar lymphadenopathies, or other lesions in the lung parenchyma were noted. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) depicted the nodule as having intense standardized uptake values of 11.8 (Fig. A), suggesting high probability of malignancy.\nA bronchoscopy was performed 10 days after the patient’s initial visit. The bronchoscopy showed a protruded white intra-bronchial tumour at the orifice of the right B8 (Fig. D). Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of the biopsied specimens obtained from the tumour (Fig. B, 40×) via endobronchial biopsy with forceps showed that a thickened stratified squamous epithelium covered the mucosal surface. However, these findings did not lead to a diagnosis. Three weeks later, she underwent a second bronchoscopy, which showed that the protruded tumour had progressed and completely occluded the lumen of the B8 (Fig. E). H&E staining of endobronchial biopsied specimens with forceps obtained from the tumour showed fragments of ciliated columnar (glandular) epithelium (Fig. C, 100×, arrow) admixed in the abundant squamous epithelium and parakeratotic debris (Fig. C, 100×, arrow head). Papanicolaou staining of the bronchial washing fluid from the right B8 demonstrated the aggregation of stratified squamous cells with orange-coloured cytoplasm (data not shown). Repeated bronchoscopy showed no evidence of malignancy or bloody phlegm irrespective of progression of the intra-bronchial tumour on thoracic CT. However, the intra-tracheal tumour was considered the source of bloody sputum. Therefore, 40 days after the patient’s first referral to our hospital, she underwent right lower lobe lobectomy via Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.\nA resection of the right lower lobe (14 × 11 × 5 cm) indicated a white-coloured papillary tumour measuring 4 cm in diameter located at the proximal portion of the dilated bronchus (Fig. D), which consequently leads to the right B8a. H&E staining showed that the tumour was composed of thick squamous (Fig. E, 5×, arrow head) and glandular (Fig. E, 5×, arrow) epithelia, both of which proliferated in a papillary pattern along with inflamed fibrovascular cores. The former (squamous) was predominant, and neither component demonstrated malignant features (Fig. F, G 100×). Immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67 found strong positivity up to the basal half of the squamous component (Fig. H, 100×). This increase of the positive index indicated active proliferation of the tumour. Upon further histological analysis, our case showed a negative result both in polymerase chain reaction for human papillomavirus (HPV) and immunohistochemical staining with p16Ink4a\n, a surrogate molecular marker of HPV. Finally, she was diagnosed with mixed squamous cell and glandular papilloma of the bronchus without HPV infection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bowel sound was sluggish.\nCBC, LFT, RFT was within normal limit.\nCT scan of abdomen was performed at another Hospital: The stomach was grossly distended, compressed with displacement of the transverse colon. The colon was filled of intra-luminal abnormal mass like contents with mottled air pattern extended to fill the pylorus and first part of duodenum. Findings were the proofs for possible trichobezoar.\nEndoscopic removal of hair was failed and the patient was prepared for the operation.\nUpper midline incision was performed and was deepened using electrocautery. After entering the abdominal cavity, distended stomach with firm content was observed. Vertical gastrostomy was done using electrocautery of about 10–14 cm in length. The stomach was found with full of ingested hair, occupying most of the stomach. Ball of hair were then retrieved and removed (A and B). Suction and irrigation were done. Negative suction tube was inserted and the position was adjusted intra-operatively. The stomach was then closed in two layers at continuous manner. First layer was closed with full-thickness using 3-0 PDS and the other layer with Lembert technique using 3-0 PDS. Then the small bowel series or test relatively collapsed with no evidence of any distal obstruction. After suction and irrigation, homeostasis was achieved and then the abdominal wall was closed by using Loop PDS. Staplers were used in surgery in place of sutures to close the skin. The patient tolerated the procedure, recovered smoothly and then was sent to the recovery room with general stable condition.\nDay 4: Post operation nasogastric tube (NGT) was removed and on the next day, the patient was discharged with outpatient clinic follow up (next week in 07/06/2017).\nIn clinic, the surgical wound was found to be infected with pus, but there was no sign of cellulites and dressing was done.\n13/06/2017: Vacuum (VAC) dressing was applied.\n22/06/2017: The wound was cleaned and VAC dressing was removed.\n31/07/2017: Patient had an appointment at the psychiatric clinic and she was found stable with no active psychiatric complains.\n20/09/2017: The wound was completely healed and the patient was discharged from the General Surgery Clinic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lesion initially presented as an indurated erythema with central dusky necrosis, mimicking insect bites (Fig. a). She didn’t recall any evident history of trauma. During the same period, she developed extensive petechiae on both lower extremities and was diagnosed as Henoch-Schӧnlein purpura in local hospital. Subsequently she was treated with systemic corticosteroids (maximum dosage 30 mg/d) for two months. While the petechiae subsided, the ankle erythema ulcerated with suppurative discharge. She was then admitted to our hospital in March, 2017. Physical examination revealed a 3.5 cm*2.5 cm demarcated ellipsoidal ulceration covered with thick black crust and purulent discharge (Fig.b). Regional lymph nodes were not palpable. Except for these lesions, the girl was generally in good health.\nHistological examination of biopsied tissue revealed multiple branching, septate hyphae and moniliform fungal elements in the dermis (Fig. a), which were positive with periodic acid–Schiff and Gomori-Grocott methenamine silver staining (Fig. b).\nTissue culture was performed and incubated at both 26 °C and 35 °C on Sabouraud’s dextrose agar (SDA) and yielded restricted, white to grey and velvety colony at 4 weeks (Fig. a). With extended incubation, the colony turned brownish at 8 weeks (Fig. b). Slides culture revealed filamentous and septate hyphae with intercalary and ballooned, chlamydospore-like structures, as well as annellidic and ampulliform conidiogenous cells along with truncated, bullet-shaped, smooth conidia (Fig. c), which resembled those found in Scopulariopsis species. Within 5 weeks, small black fruiting structures were growing on the surface of the colony, resulting in observance of globose perithecial ascomata with cylindrical necks, and a dark peridium (Fig. d). Fungal culture was identified as M. cirrosus based on the morphological features and confirmed by the molecular sequencing of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region gene and β-tubulin gene. Comparison of the ITS (642 bp) (Genbank accession number MF450505) and β-tubulin (501 bp) (Genbank accession number MF455507) sequence with the Genbank database revealed 100% similarity with M. cirrosus reference strain CBS 116405 and CBS 115860, respectively.\nIn vitro susceptibility was tested according to the guidelines presented in document M38-A2 of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) []. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined visually as the concentration that resulted in 100% inhibition []. The minimal effective concentration (MEC) endpoint was taken as the lowest concentration at which the visual growth pattern change from granular to filamentous growth was detected, microscopically seen as restricted hyphal growth. The results revealed that multiple antifungal agents were inactive against the isolate, with MIC value of 4 μg/ml for voriconazole (VRC), 8 μg/ml for caspofungin (CAS), >64 μg/ml for fluconazole (FLZ), >16 μg/ml for itraconazole (ITC), posaconazole (POS), amphotericin B (AMB) and terbinafine (TRB), and MEC value of > 16 μg/ml for micafungin (MCF). Due to the patient’s economic condition, itraconazole was applied. However, despite the discouraging result of in vitro susceptibilities, significant improvement of skin lesions was achieved after 10 weeks treatment with itraconazole 200 mg per day (Fig. c). No adverse event was reported.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ultrasonography incidentally revealed a multiseptated cystic mass in the pelvis. Family history and past medical history were unremarkable, and her menstrual cycle was regular. Blood cell counts and blood biochemistry were normal. Serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19–9) were all within normal limits, while cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) was elevated at 76.3 U/mL (normal range 0–35.0). Levels of serum hormones including estradiol (76.3 ng/ml; normal range, 22–144 ng/ml), luteinizing hormone (LH; 4.7mIU) /ml and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH; 2.9 mIU/ml) were normal.\nPelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 141 × 96 × 127-mm well-demarcated multilocular cystic mass with irregularly thickened septa and solid components originating in the left adnexa. On T2WI, the signal intensities of the cystic components had the same SI as water, and those of the irregularly thickened septa and solid components had intermediate SI, higher than the SI of uterine myometrium (Fig. a). On T1WI, the septa and solid components had slight higher SI than uterine myometrium and showed early strong enhancement on contrast-enhanced T1WI (Fig. b) and slight hyperintensity on DWI (Fig. c). PET-CT showed mild FDG uptake in solid components of the tumor (SUV: 2.11) (Fig. ).\nThe preoperative imaging diagnosis was SST or granulosa cell tumor, and it was not likely to be associated with a malignant ovarian tumor because of its low FDG uptake.\nThe patient underwent left oophorectomy and omentectomy. The cystic mass originated in the left ovary and measured 15 cm in diameter. Grossly, some thickened septa were observed in the mass but there were no obvious solid components. The cysts contained clear, straw-colored fluid.\nHistological examination revealed that the mass consisted of hypercellular areas with prominent vascular networks separated by hypocellular areas that corresponded to collagenous and edematous areas, or a so-called “pseudolobular appearance”. Coarse collagenous fibers surrounding individual cells formed collagen bundles between cells, leading to heterogeneous cell density even in cellular areas (Fig. a). The hypercellular areas were composed of a dual cell population of collagen-producing bland spindled cells and rounded epithelioid cells. Prominent vascular networks with a hemangiopericytomatous pattern were observed (Fig. b). Immunohistochemically, tumor cells were positive for α–inhibin. Thus, the final histological diagnosis was SST of the ovary.\nWe searched the PubMed database for previous cases published in English from 1966 to September 2017 with the terms of “sclerosing stromal tumor”, “ovary” and “imaging”.\nThe results showed only one report describing PET findings for SST and three reports describing imaging findings on DWI for SST, including the above-mentioned report describing PET findings. Imaging findings on PET and DWI are summarized in Table .\nAccording to one report describing PET findings of SST, the tumor showed intense FDG uptake (SUV max: 7.0). Although SST tended to show high SI on DWI, the exact degree of high SI varied between cases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Computed tomography showed the intestine, mesentery, colon, and kidney inside the right hemithorax (Figures –); uniform and continuous diaphragmatic elevation throughout the hemithorax (Figures and ); discrete mediastinal displacement caused by the right kidney (); and hepatic displacement towards the left hemiabdomen causing gastric compression (). The right lung was found to be collapsed.\nLaparoscopy revealed visceral displacement, severe elevation of the diaphragmatic dome, and hepatic displacement; there was no diaphragmatic rupture, defined as eventration. The right colon and part of the transverse colon were adhered to the dome. The pedicle of the intrathoracic right kidney ran through the foramen of Bochdalek (). A posterolateral thoracotomy was continued at the level of the seventh intercostal space, with the hemidiaphragm being thinned, although with moderate thickness of muscle fibers (). An incision was made for hemidiaphragm plication. This was safely performed given the proximity of the peritoneal viscera (). It was sutured with prolene 0. A dual mesh of polypropylene-PTFE was placed for reinforcement and fixed at the level of diaphragmatic periphery (). There was an improvement of respiratory symptoms. The chest radiograph showed expansion of the hemidiaphragm, pulmonary field, and residual renal silhouette in the intrathoracic position (). The patient stayed in the hospital for 12 days with an adequate evolution of the respiratory symptomatology and the operative wound. The pleural effusion through the chest tube was high and remained constant in the first 4 weeks and decreased 2 weeks later, after which we had removed the thoracic tube.

Her height was within the normal range during childhood (< 4 years) but gradually began to be under the normal growth curve, ultimately resulting in grown-up short stature.\nThe patient was the first child of an unrelated Chinese couple. Her mother underwent vaginal delivery after a full-term pregnancy. The birth weight of the girl was 4 kg and the birth length was 50 cm. She exhibited no neurological defects or skeletal abnormalities, no diabetes mellitus or its related symptoms, and no family history of cancer. The patient’s parents, younger sister and brother had no significant medical history (Fig. ).\nOn physical examination, the patient exhibited extensive, velvety, thick, hyperpigmented plaques involving the neck, back, and axillae (Fig. ). The patient was a non-dysmorphic girl with the height of 146 cm (<-2SD).\nLaboratory tests revealed no abnormal biochemical findings (Table ). The thyroid hormone, cortisol and androgen levels were within the normal range (the testosterone level demonstrated in Table was under the reference range, we tested testosterone one more time, and the other value was normal: 31.8 ng/dl). Fasting blood glucose and fasting insulin level were 88.2 mg/dL and 13.78μU/ml, respectively. The homeostasis assessment index for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) as the outcome of the fasting insulin (mUI/ml) × glucose (mmol/l) /22.5 was 3.0. This result indicated no insulin resistance. These findings excluded the diagnosis of insulin resistance, T2D, Cushing’s syndrome and hyperandrogenism.\nX-ray examination (done at 14 years old) revealed no abnormalities (Fig. ).\nAs genetic mutations have been recognized in several cases of syndromic AN, a mutational analysis was performed in the proband and parents. Written informed consent was signed by the proband and her parents.\nPeripheral blood samples (4 ml) of the proband and her parents were collected. Genomic DNA was extracted from the blood using a QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen China Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. We first performed whole exome sequencing for the proband. Next, based on the test results of whole exome sequencing, the presence of the mutation in the proband and her parents was confirmed with direct Sanger sequencing of the affected exon.\nAll coding exons were enriched using the xGen Exome Research Panel v1.0 (Integrated DNA Technology, Inc). Captured DNA libraries were sequenced on Illumina Hiseq X Ten according to the manufacturer’s instructions for paired-end 150 bp reads. Variants were considered as pathogenic mutations if they exhibited the following components: i) rare or absent in the above genome databases; ii) variation expected to have a drastic effect on the protein (nonsense mutation, frame shift mutation, mutation at a splice site, or missense mutation is highly conserved among species); and iii) variation predicted to be damaging.\nSanger sequencing of the affected exon in FGFR3 was performed on DNA samples from the proband and her parents. According to the DNA sequence of the FGFR3 gene, primers of exon 14 of FGFR3 were designed using Primer Premier 5 software. The functional effects of protein variants were predicted by PolyPhen2 (/), SIFT () and Mutation Taster ().\nThrough data mining, combined with genetic characteristics and clinical manifestations, we identified a heterozygous c.1949A > C, p.Lys650Thr mutation in FGFR3 of the proband, which is considered to be a pathogenic mutation. As the proband’s parents did not carry the mutation, the mutation identified in the proband was a de novo mutation. Sanger sequencing confirmation is shown in Fig. . The mutation caused change in the protein from K to T at p. Lys650, which is located in exon 14 of FGFR3. The pathogenicity of the mutation on bone and skin has been previously reported [–] and was confirmed using 3 different software programmes (The expected score scales of the mutation from each software programme are shown in Additional file : Table S1): SIFT (0), PolyPhen-2 (1) and Mutation taster (disease-causing).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pregnancy was uneventful and psychomotor development was normal.\nAt age 11 years a first sleep-related tonic-clonic seizure, lasting several minutes appeared. A first EEG recording showed discharges of generalized spikes and polyspike-waves together with multifocal, centro-parieto-temporal paroxysmal activity. Brain MRI was unrevealing. Treated with valproic acid and clobazam, she was seizure-free for nearly 2 years. At age 13-years, seizures relapsed and over time became drug-resistant despite different antiepileptic drug combinations, including ethosuximide, lamotrigine, benzodiazepines, acetazolamide, levetiracetam, topiramate, lacosamide and barbiturates. Seizures occurred 2–3 times per month, predominantly during sleep, as tonic-clonic, lasting several minutes and occasionally requiring acute treatment with rectal diazepam. In the same period, parents also noticed daily episodes of loss of contact and interruption of motor activity with a slight head drop and eyelid fluttering, lasting 10–20 s. Long-term video-EEG monitoring captured sleep-related seizures, with the tonic-clonic phase being preceded by a crescendo of myoclonic and clonic jerks (Fig. ). We also recorded several episodes of ictal eyelid myoclonia with absences associated with polyspike and wave discharges. The interictal EEG was severely abnormal with frequent discharges of generalized or multifocal paroxysmal activity, yet the most interesting features were observed during sleep with activation of severe paroxysmal discharges and absence of a recognizable physiological EEG pattern. EEG also showed a prominent photosensitivity. During intermittent photic stimulation, we recorded a generalized photoparoxysmal response often provoking eyelid myoclonia.\nAfter the onset of seizure, she also manifested cognitive regression, leading to mild-moderate cognitive impairment. Haemoglobin levels and white blood cell values were normal, although at the lower end of normal limits. Trombocytopenia was not found. At age 16 years, neuropsychological testing showed a global IQ score of 65 (WISC-IV). Neurological evaluation revealed mild dysarthria, increased deep reflexes, mild dysmetria, inability to walk on toes, and upper extremity tremor and myoclonus. Somatosensory and visual evoked potentials revealed responses of abnormally high amplitude (grossly enlarged potentials).\nClinical features, particularly their onset and evolution, EEG features, and evoked potentials were suggestive of progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Abdominal ultrasound and MRI revealed also a mildly enlarged liver. The magnetic resonance (MR) imaging bone marrow burden (BMB) score was 3. Thus, considering all the above findings combined with age at symptoms onset, we investigated the patient for Lafora disease and lysosomal disorders, including GD.\nAt clinical evaluation spleen and liver were of normal size. At abdominal MRI the liver was at the upper limit of normal (2626 cc). There was neither anemia nor thrombocytopenia. Since, in keeping with GD, β-glucosidase activity in blood spots was deficient, we performed GBA gene screening and skin biopsy for further molecular and enzyme activity assays to confirm the diagnosis.\nOnce the diagnosis was confirmed the enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) was instituted. At present, the patient, aged 17 years, exhibits drug-resistant epilepsy with daily myoclonic and monthly tonic-clonic seizures, often while asleep and during her periods, prominent photosensitivity, mild-moderate cognitive impairment with dysarthria and upper limb tremor and an abnormal bone marrow burden. Haematological values and BMB were unchanged. The clinical picture is fluctuating, yet slowly progressive, and ERT is of no benefit on neurological symptoms, considering also this treatment does not pass the brain blood barrier.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No family history iof hypoglycemia was reported. He was born by emergency C-section at an outside medical center when fetal monitoring revealed a flat strip. At the time of delivery, his APGAR scores were 2 at 1 min, and 6 at 5 min. His initial arterial blood gas was pH 7.13, pO2 65, pCO2 40 mmHg, base excess (− 9.2). His initial plasma glucose level was 7 mg/dL. He received an IV bolus with D12.5%, followed by IV fluids (IVF) with a glucose infusion rate (GIR) of 6.9 mg/kg/min. The infant was transferred to our hospital at day of life (DOL) 2 for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), supraventricular tachycardia, and hypoplastic aortic arch as well as persistent hypoglycemia.\nDuring his hospital stay, the GIR was gradually increased to 16 mg/kg/min. Polycose supplement was added to his feeds with the goal of maintaining plasma glucose levels close to 70 mg/dL when titrating IV dextrose. However, on DOL 21, he developed hypoglycemic episodes (BG below 50 mg/dL) after IV dextrose was weaned off and despite consuming 26 cal/oz. of formula. Extensive workup for CHI was initiated on DOL 25, and the results revealed an elevated insulin level of 16.3 mcIU/mL coincident with a plasma glucose level of 48 mg/dL and beta hydroxybutyrate level of less than 100 mcmol/L. Ammonia, pyruvic acid, cortisol level,, serum amino acids, acyl carnitine profile, and urine organic acids were all in the normal range (Table ). A pediatric endocrinology consultation was performed and DNA sequencing for CHI was ordered, revealing a heterozygous maternally-inherited likely pathogenic variant in KCNJ11, c.616C > T (p.Arg206Cys).

At the arrival to the Emergency Dept (ED), he was alert and hemodynamically stable and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 15; the initial alignment of the fractured ends was performed in the ED with a gentle traction performed under sedation with iv. ketamine; a total body CT did not demonstrate other injuries. Approximately two hours after the admission the patient was taken to the surgical theatre for the external fixation of the fractured bones; at entering the operating room, the GCS was 8, the arterial pressure was 115/80 mm Hg, the heart rate was 115 bpm, and the arterial oxygen saturation (SPO2) was 85 at room air; the procedure was performed under general iv anesthesia with propofol and remifentanyl; the standard monitoring included the ECG, the noninvasive arterial pressure, the SPO2, and the end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2); during the intervention, the SPO2 rose to 100% at a FIO2=40% and all the other variables remained stable throughout the procedure after the 3-hour-long intervention in which the complete alignment of the bony ends was achieved; the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) still intubated and mechanically ventilated; the iv anaesthetics were gradually tapered until the complete suspension. Two hours later, the SpaO2 and the ETCO2 slightly decreased and anisocoria was observed; and an urgent CT scan of the head demonstrated a diffuse cerebral edema and the herniation of the cerebellar tonsils (Figures and , respectively). At this time, the pupils became bilaterally mydriatic and the EEG was almost isoelectric; due to the severity of the conditions, a MR scan was considered unnecessary. On the basis of the clinical and radiologic findings repeated boluses of iv. mannitol and steroids were given in the following hours aiming to reduce the intracranial pressure. An echocardiogram demonstrated a severe right ventricular depression with an ejection fraction of 20%. On the following day, the patient was declared brain dead according to the current Italian law.\nAt the autopsy, the cerebral microvascular network appeared diffusely plugged with BME (Figures –) and ischemia-related microcalcifications were scattered throughout the brain (); other organs were less extensively involved; no PFO was demonstrated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He fell off a 3-foot cliff while hiking and landed on the right side of his chest. On presentation, the patient's pain was tolerable and he was breathing comfortably. His vital signs showed a pulse of 98 beats per minute, blood pressure of 110/60 mmHg, and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. His exam revealed minimal abrasions, ecchymosis, and tenderness over the right lower chest wall at the anterior axillary line. His lung exam revealed decreased breath sounds over the right lower lung field. A chest X-ray obtained within 2 hours of the trauma showed alveolar opacities in the right lower lobe with multiple cystic air spaces containing air-fluid levels (). There were no associated pleural effusions, pneumothorax, or rib fractures. A Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed thick-walled multicystic lesions with patchy air space opacities and consolidations in the right lower lobe (). No previous chest imaging was available for comparison. The described CT scan abnormalities, in the absence of extrapulmonary posttraumatic findings, were suggestive of CPAM with superimposed bleeding. The patient was admitted for observation and evaluation and placed on intravenous Amoxicillin/Clavulanate. Spirometry done the next day was normal. His complete blood count, basic metabolic panel and bleeding profile were normal. His C-reactive protein was elevated at 32.0 mg/L. Gram stain, acid fast stain, and sputum cultures for bacteria, fungi, and tuberculosis were all negative. Alpha-1 antitrypsin and immunoglobulin levels were within normal limits.\nThe patient was evaluated by a cardiothoracic surgeon and a right lower lobectomy was being considered. However, given the indolent course of his disease and his negative history for pulmonary infections thus far, the patient elected to defer further surgical evaluation and, instead, follow-up with clinical observation. He remained asymptomatic throughout the interval period and a chest X-ray repeated after one year was normal ().

His interphalangeal joints were first involved, and then the elbows, knees, and hips. He was misdiagnosed with developmental dysplasia of hips at the age of 9 in another hospital and received no treatment. Physical examination showed swaying gait with fixed flexion deformity of hips and knees (Fig. A). Multiple interphalangeal joints were enlarged (Fig. B). Impaired range of motion of his interphalangeal joints, elbows, and wrists was observed. Hip flexion-extension was 70° to −45° in the left and 80° to −40° in the right. Knee flexion-extension was 120° to −40° in the left and 120° to −45° in the right. No obvious scoliosis or thoracic kyphosis was noticed. Babinski sign was negative and the knee-jerk reflex was normal. Laboratory tests including blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, antistreptolysin O, and anticyclic cirullinated peptide antibodies were normal. Preoperative visual analog score (VAS) was 7 and the Harris hip score was 32.\nRadiograph of pelvis showed broadening width of the pubic symphysis, enlargement of femoral heads, narrowed hip joint space, and osteoarthritis of hips. Radiograph of knees demonstrated enlargement of femoral condylar and narrowed joint space (Fig. A). Spinal X-rays revealed platyspondyly, irregular end plates, and mild scoliosis (Fig. B).\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient and the guardians. Genetic testing for the WISP3 gene was done and showed compound heterozygous mutations: NM_198239.1 (WISP3): c.1064_1065dupGT (p.Gln356ValfsTer33) and NM_198239.1 (WISP3): c.643 + 2T > C. Combined with the patient's history, symptoms, physical signs, and genetic testing, the final definitive diagnosis is PPD.\nDeduced from radiographs, the hip and knee joint space was decreased but still had room for remodeling by Ilizarov fixator, since this technique provides with secure fixation against persistent stress and tension, and allows for mild-to-moderate daily activities during treatment. Soft tissue around the contractural knee was stretched gradually is the rational for the Ilizarov techniques. Thus, we carefully worked out preoperative plans according to the condition of the patient and the characteristics of Ilizarov fixator. To deal with severe joint contractures, tenolysis, and soft tissue release needed to be performed, before imposing the fixator, by a 3-cm subinguinal longitudinal incision and another one at gastrocnemius tendon. After that, 4 steel rings should be placed sequentially at the mid-thigh, 5 cm above the knee cap, 5 cm below the knee cap, and above the ankle, and each ring required a piece of K-wire applied by percutaneous corticotomy cuts. Instead of being placed at a parallel pattern, the K-wires should be fixed at different angles, by a rotation of 45° at each plane, to form a stable 3-dimensional structure. We planned to extend the fixator 0.5 to 0.1 cm each day, adjusted by the tolerance of the patient, till a full extension of the lower extremity. Then, the same procedure should be applied to the opposite side, and a cast be used to consolidate the right limb for the same amount of time as dealing with the left limb.\nAt the first stage, we performed the surgery in his right hip and knee. The patient underwent the surgery under general anesthesia in a supine position. Firstly, the proximal end of rectus femoris muscle was released, and then the hamstring muscle and semitendinosus were released. After that, common peroneal nerve lysis was done. After checking the tension of common peroneal nerve, the Ilizarov external fixation apparatus was placed. After the operation, the Ilizarov external fixation apparatus was lengthened 5 to 10 mm/d (Fig. ). Hip and knee passive movement was also performed every day. Thirteen days after the operation, the flexion deformity of his right hip and knee was greatly improved (Fig. A). There is no possibility of growth potential in this patient which can affect the result for closure of epiphysis.\nThirty-six days after the operation, the Ilizarov technique was performed to his left hip and knee by the same procedures and plaster cast for his right lower extremity was placed at the same time (Fig. B). One month after the stage 2 surgery, external fixation apparatus and plaster cast were removed. The follow-up time period is 1 year. One year after the operation, the improvement of joint deformity was satisfactory (Fig. C). The follow-up results are demonstrated in Table . There was no complication observed in this patient.

He reported pain at the left side of the umbilicus. Body weight increased by 5 kg in one year. Computed tomography (CT) was performed at another hospital. A larger abdominal tumor was detected, so he was referred to our hospital for examination. Vital signs and laboratory data were normal, but the abdomen was bulging slightly. CT showed a giant tumor occupying the majority of the abdominal cavity (Figures – and –). The tumor seemed to be divided into two parts. One part was a single cystic lesion, which had no contrast effect from the right abdomen to the pelvic cavity. The other part, from left upper abdomen to the lower abdomen, appeared to have a solid component where the contrast effect was mild. The vessel was seen from the left gastroepiploic artery to the tumor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the tumor had almost entirely low signal density, but T1-weighted image (T1WI), some parts had high signal density (). In T2-weighted image (T2WI), on the other hand, the tumor showed high signal intensity ().\nOn the gadolinium-enhanced image, the contrast effect was poor, and the high signal area was only slight.\nPreoperative diagnosis was a giant abdominal cystic tumor. Differential diagnosis was gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), DT, or lymphangioma.\nSurgery was performed for definitive diagnosis and improvement of the symptoms.\nA lower midline incision was performed to observe the large tumor contained within a membrane (). The tumor was found to be adhered to both the mesocolon and omentum, and blood vessels were observed to be coming from both; angered vessels bled easily. Fluid in the right part of the tumor was aspirated; about 1.7 L greenish-brown fluid was collected. We separated the tumor from the mesocolon. The omentum artery of the stomach was preserved, and the omentum was also separated from the tumor. In this time, we judged that the tumor originated from the anterior lobe of the transverse mesocolon. The tumor was in contact with the great curvature of the stomach. The adhesion could not be separated, so we partially resected the stomach. The branches from the left gastroepiploic artery had become thick, indicating it was probably the main feeder of the tumor. Furthermore, the tumor was also strongly in contact with the pancreatic tail (). The border line was unclear. If the pancreatic tail was preserved, the capsule of the tumor remained, and the possibility of recurrence existed. So pancreatic tail resection was performed, and the tumor was excised. The tumor itself was 4.2 kg, and aspirated fluid was 1.7 L, so the total tumor weight was 5.9 kg. Operation time was 2 hr 32 min, and bleeding volume was 220 mL.\nThe tumor is shown in Figures –. It measured 30 × 25 × 10.5 cm. On the right side of the tumor, a cystic component with wall thickening was found. When the tumor was incised, there was a mixture of solid components and parts that showed honeycomb-like texture.\nPathological findings included spindle-shaped or star-shaped tumor cells proliferating diffusely with abundant collagen fiber. Heteromorphism was not noticeable, and the nuclear fission image was not apparent. Beta-catenin was positive in the tumor cell nucleus on immunohistochemistry (Figures and ).\nFinal diagnosis was an intra-abdominal desmoid tumor.\nPostoperative pancreatic fistula occurred but was improved with nonoperative therapy. The patient was discharged on the 16th postoperative day. After discharge, colonoscopy (CS) was unremarkable.

Following an uneventful pregnancy, the patient was the first child of non-consanguineous Caucasian parents. Due to jaundice and elevated indirect bilirubin levels, he was diagnosed with GS soon after delivery as he had the A(TA)7TAA allele in homozygous state (identified by fragment analysis as previously described []). During his childhood years, the patient did well. He periodically underwent phenobarbital treatment for the reduction of bilirubin levels associated with jaundice; the mean bilirubin levels achieved as the result of these treatments were 100–200 μmol/L. The patient’s parents had no complaints until puberty.\nAfter reaching puberty, the boy became severely jaundiced and his bilirubin levels increased to 300–350 μmol/L. However, there were no other complaints, he was doing well in school and his weight and height parameters were according to his age. The boy was referred to a hepatologist and multiple investigations were carried out. No pathological findings were observed in the laboratory analysis and hepatitis viral markers were negative. Furthermore, there was no evidence of other inborn errors of metabolism, i.e. organic acidurias and amino acidurias or changes in the fatty acid profile.\nThe results of abdominal ultrasound and abdominal MRI were unremarkable. Procurement of a percutaneous liver biopsy revealed no pathological findings. Based on isolated elevation of indirect bilirubin levels from standard laboratory investigations, reduced glutathione (0.89 mmol/l; reference value 1.12–1.216 mmol/l), a glucuronide level in 24-h urine of up to 102 mg/ml (reference value 430–600 mg/ml), phenobarbital responsiveness, and no evidence of kernicterus (as the child had no complaints about his health condition), CNS-II was suspected.\nTo confirm the CNS-II diagnosis, bidirectional sequencing of five exons and exon/intron boundaries of the gene UGT1A1 (OMIM: 191740) was performed using previously described primers [] and a BigDye 3.0 kit (following the manufacturer’s protocol; Applied Biosystems, USA). The nomenclature of the identified variations was identified by using Mutalyzer () and assessed sequentially against the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database (dbSNP; ), Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC; exac.), ClinVar (), and the UGT1A1 variant database []. A search was performed with MEDLINE if the variation was not found in any of the aforementioned databases. The biological significance of observed nucleotide changes located at splice sites was assessed using the Human Splicing Finder (HSF) 3.0 [] and MutationTaster [].\nFour different variants in the UGT1A1 gene were identified in the patient: g.3664A > C (c.1352A > C, rs3755319); g.4963_4964TA[7] (c.-53_-52insTA, A(TA)7TAA, UGT1A1*28, rs8175347); g.5884G > T (c.864 + 5G > T, IVS1 + 5G > T); and g.11895_11898del (c.996+2_996+5del) (reference sequence NG_033238.1) .\nIn the ClinVar database, the variant g.4963_4964TA[7] is described as a variant affecting response to drug treatment. This is the most common variant identified in patients with GS. The variant g.3664A > C, as reported in the ClinVar database, causes transient familial neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (OMIM: 237900). The variant g.5884G > T located in the first intron has previously been reported in a patient with CNS-II [], and from exome sequencing has been identified only in Europeans in five alleles (exac.). The second intronic variant g.11895_11898del (located in second intron two nucleotides after the second exon) is reported for the first time (sequence showed in the Fig. ). Considering that one of the criteria for evaluating variant pathogenicity is its frequency in the healthy population, 90 healthy individuals from the Genome Database of the Latvian Population (LGDB), a government-funded biobank (the principle of LGDB has previously been reported []), were randomly selected and screened for the two lesser-described variants g.5884G > T and g.11895_11898del. The screened variants were not identified for any of the selected individuals. In order to identify variant segregation in the family, the parents were assessed for all the variants (Fig. ). Both parents demonstrated normal-range levels of bilirubin from multiple measurements.\nThe intronic variants not mentioned in the ClinVar database were annotated according to ACMG standards and guidelines []. Both variants are classified as likely pathogenic (for variant g.5884G > T – fulfilled criteria PM2, PM3, PP3, PP4, PP5; for variant g.11895_11898del – fulfilled criteria PM2, PM3, PP3, PP4; Table ).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JosEpH RodRIgueZ,17,M,B-,Arthritis,14-06-2023,Jeffrey James,Cole-Gonzalez,UnitedHealthcare,35255.66868,322,Emergency,09-07-2023,Aspirin,Inconclusive,"A 17-year-old Caucasian boy was admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) after successful resuscitation by emergency services. While performing running exercise in a fitness center, he suddenly collapsed. Because neither pulse nor breathing could be detected by the bystanders, immediate resuscitation was performed. In the first heart rhythm analysis conducted by the paramedics, ventricular fibrillation (VF) was seen and immediately defibrillated into sinus rhythm. The patient recovered quickly and was transferred to our ICU by the ambulance service. At admission, the patient was in hemodynamically stable condition with normal vital signs (heart rate 95/min, blood pressure 125/79 mmHg, auricular temperature 36.5 °C, respiration 15 breaths/min, oxygen saturation of 100% on 4-L nasal cannula). The physical examination revealed no abnormal findings. Auscultation of the heart showed a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs or rubs. The breath sounds of the lungs were equal and clear bilaterally with no wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. The patient was awake (Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15) and orientated in all aspects. No focal sensory or motor deficits, aphasia, or inadequate balances were noted in the neurological examination. Deep tendon reflexes and cranial nerves II through XII were intact. Because there were no cerebral or other sequelae at the time of hospital admission, we decided not to obtain a cranial computed tomographic scan, owing to the patient’s young age. When asked about the event, he told us that he had no symptoms prior to the collapse. However, in the years before, he had syncopated several times while climbing stairs, playing soccer, and once when he got frightened. A general practitioner previously performed an exercise ECG, which showed multiple premature beats under submaximal stress (Fig. ). As a result, beta-blockers were prescribed (metoprolol succinate 47.5 mg once per day). Apart from this, the patient had no medical history or prior medication. The patient was a nonsmoker with no regular alcohol consumption and an unremarkable family, social, and environmental history.\nAt ICU admission, initial medical treatment included the first surface ECG after cardiac arrest, which showed negative T-waves in V1 and biphasic T-waves in V2 (Fig. ). The results of blood tests showed normal findings without signs of cardiac ischemia or metabolic disorders (Table ). Respiratory disorders (bronchospasm, aspiration) or neurovascular events seemed to be unlikely because the physical examination, blood gas analysis, and a pulmonary x-ray showed normal findings. An echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular function without wall motion abnormalities, right heart strain, or valve disease. Additionally, a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging scan was performed and showed normal findings. Therefore, we ruled out hypertrophic and dilative cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, and acute myocarditis as potential differential diagnoses. Further diagnostic workup included coronary angiography and electrophysiological testing, but none of those resulted in any relevant finding.\nBecause no extracardiac cause or structural heart disease was found, diagnostic workup focused on channelopathies and genetic heart diseases. Owing to the patient’s medical history of stress-dependent syncope, we strongly suspected a CPVT as the underlying mechanism for VF. Genetic screening was performed and confirmed the diagnosis of CPVT, revealing a new heterozygous point mutation in the gene for ryanodine receptor type 2, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been described to date in the literature. The heterozygous mutation c.12520T>A (p.F4174 l, exon 90, RyR2 gene) results in an exchange of phenylalanine to isoleucine at position 4174 of the RyR2 protein. Forty-five percent of the relevant mutations of RyR are located in this region []. This novel identified missense mutation is located in the C-terminal channel region as a residue of the hydrophobic side chain of the S6/U motif interface of RyR2 [].\nPrediction algorithms for forecasting functional effects of a mutation clearly identify this mutation to potentially cause CPVT []. Genetic screening of both parents showed that neither of them were carriers of the mutation. Results of further screening of the patient and family members for other pathogenic mutations (long or short QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome) were also negative.\nOn the basis of of our findings, the patient received an ICD device to protect him from recurrent episodes of VF. Additionally, oral medication with a beta-blocker was continued with the maximum tolerable dose. Because of the relatively small number of documented arrhythmic episodes, we did not add flecainide at that point. Left ventricular sympathetic denervation was discussed with the patient and the family, but in the end it was deferred.\nAt hospital discharge, the patient was included in our home monitoring program for ICD surveillance. Shortly after implantation, the ICD terminated a sustaining VT by antitachycardic pacing (Fig. ). This episode occurred early in the morning while the patient was asleep, which is an uncommon situation for arrhythmic events in patients with CPVT. However, the patient had no memory of a possible emotional stress due to dreams. In the following 6 months, a single episode of VF occurred during a physical activity (cycling), this time terminating spontaneously.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He had no relevant prior medical history and did not consume alcohol, tobacco, or drugs. On arrival at the emergency room, he was hemodynamically stable, afebrile, and neurologically intact with no need for supplemental oxygen. On physical examination, a stony nodular mass of approximately 0.5 cm on the upper pole of the right testicle which is not painful on palpation was observed. No adenopathies were found. Imaging studies showed multiple round multilobed heterogeneous hypodense lung lesions with a stained glass appearance and poor central enhancement after administration of contrast medium. These were bilateral and randomly distributed; some were subpleural with the appearance of “cannonballs” (). The most representative was seen at the level of the upper segment of the right lower lobe, measuring 5.9 × 5.7 × 5.6 cm (). At the level of the vertebral body L4, a large adenopathy 4.7 × 3.1 cm with a hypodense center indicative of necrosis was found. This adenopathy compressed the inferior vena cava without compromising its lumen. The right testicle had a heterogeneous appearance with calcifications inside. Serum levels of β-hCG were 222,493.21 IU/L, AFP 1.56 ng/mL, and DHL 457 IU/L. A brain MRI showed no relevant alterations. The patient underwent radical right orchidectomy with no complications. A biopsy revealed a mixed multifocal germ-cell tumor 0.3 × 0.2 cm, limited to the right testicle with an embryonic component of 90%, a mature teratoma component of 5%, and a seminoma component of 5%. There was no involvement of the spermatic cord or lymphovascular invasion. After assessment by a multidisciplinary oncology team, it was decided to start a chemotherapy (CT) regimen based on bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin for four cycles due to poor-risk characteristics. The patient received his first cycle in a hospital with an adequate clinical response and a favorable tumor marker decline rate. After surveillance, he was discharged to continue ambulatory treatment. At 5 months of follow-up, the patient is alive, receiving second-line CT due to persistent pulmonary disease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initially, her movements were slower, her hands were clumsy, and she could not speak clearly. In the past 20 days, she gradually developed dysdipsia, unsteady gait, dyskinesia, significantly increased involuntary movements of limbs and fell > 4 times. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed abnormal signals in bilateral basal ganglia and thalamus. Electroencephalography (EEG) demonstrated diffused 4–6 Hz theta waves. Slit-lamp examination showed Kayser–Fleischer (KF) ring in both eyes. Her serum ceruloplasmin concentration was 0.033 g/L (Normal range: 0.2–0.6). The symptoms progressively worsened, and she had a fever, with temperature between 37.5 and 38.0 °C, without chills, cough or diarrhea. The patient had difficulty in opening her mouth, could only speak one word at a time, and had occasional torsion spasm at the time of admission.\nThe patient had xerostomia, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, frequent oral ulcers, with no significant weight loss. There was no history of other diseases, but her mother recalled that she talked less, had behavioral changes, abnormal gait, involuntary smile and involuntary movements of all limbs since five years. The parents and older sister did not have similar symptoms. Physical examination revealed that the patient had normal comprehension, with low-grade fever, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, dystonia, lack of coordination, slight tremor, dysarthria, dysphagia and right side Babinski sign positive.\nAfter admission, routine tests revealed decreased white blood cell count of 2.87*109/L (Normal range: 4–10). Liver function test showed slightly elevated transaminase level and normal bilirubin level. Albumin level was decreased to 32 g/L (Normal range: > 35). Renal parameters were marginally elevated with proteinuria (1.12 g/24 h) and hematuria (++). Lumbar puncture showed elevated intracranial pressure, normal white blood cell count of 2/ul, elevated protein of 0.69 g/L and elevated immunoglobulin G (IgG) of 58.8 mg/L (Normal range: 0–40). Anti-AQP-4 (Anti-aquaporin 4) IgG and myelin basic protein were negative. MRI revealed symmetric abnormal signals with low signal in T1-weighted image, and high signals in T2-weighted and FLAIR images of bilateral basal ganglia thalamus, midbrain, and pons (Fig. ). Computed tomography (CT) scans revealed diffused lesions in the liver, uneven density, and hepatosplenomegaly. The patient, her parents and her sister underwent genotype test for WD, which showed that the patient had a compound heterozygous mutation, while her family members did not.\nOther laboratory findings included elevated ESR, C-reactive protein, IgG, IgM and hypocomplementemia. The titers of antinuclear antibody (ANA) (S1:640), anti-SSA antibody (+++) and anti-rRNP antibody (+++) were remarkably increased, while anticardiolipin antibodies (ACL), Lupus anticoagulants (LA), and anti-β2-glycoprotein-1 (anti-β2GP1) antibodies were all positive. Stomatological and ophthalmological evaluations provided objective evidence of salivary gland (salivary flow rate and parotid sialography) and ocular (Schirmer’s test and ocular dye score) involvement. Salivary gland biopsy showed typical histopathology of Sjögren syndrome. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed normal arteries, and ultrasound examinations of arteries and veins of bilateral legs, bilateral subclavian, supra-mesenteric, inferior-mesenteric, bilateral renal found no thrombotic evidence.\nBased on all the findings, the final diagnosis for this patient was WD, SLE, secondary Sjögren syndrome with anti-phospholipid (aPL) antibodies. Therefore, we started therapy with iv sodium dimercaptopropane sulfonate (DMPS), full dose zinc sulfate for WD, and methylprednisolone (80 mg iv for 7 days, then 40 mg po for 3 weeks), and hydroxychloroquine po for SLE, respectively. Since has three kinds of aPL antibodies were positive, the patient was also treated with anticoagulant therapy (low molecular weight heparin, and then aspirin po). One month later, her neurological symptoms and laboratory tests showed improvement. WBC count, liver function test including transaminase level, bilirubin level and serum albumin level, urine test, ESR, CRP, IgG and complement levels were all normal. Repeat lumbar puncture showed normal parameters. The titer of ANA had declined (S1:160), and aPL (ACL, LA, anti-β2GP1) antibodies were negative. The steroid dosage was gradually tapered and the patient was given oral dimercaptosuccinate (DMSA), zinc sulfate, hydroxychloroquine and aspirin for maintenance.\nThe patient was followed-up every three months at the outpatient clinic. Six months after discharge, her symptoms recurred, and she developed hyponatremia, hematuria and proteinuria, when the steroid was reduced to 2 mg/day. Hence, methylprednisolone dosage was increased to 16 mg/day, while the other treatment remained unchanged. Symptoms and abnormal laboratory findings were relieved in the next follow-up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She took prescription colchicine at a dose of 15 mg (30 tablets 0.5 mg each), which is equivalent to 0.2 mg/kg. As her condition did not improve, she was brought to the emergency department. She had a past medical history of fibromyalgia, in addition to intestinal Behçet’s disease. Prior to admission, she was taking Neurotropin® (non-protein extract isolated from the inflamed skin of rabbits inoculated with vaccinia virus), pregabalin, butylscopolamine bromide, Lactomin (lactic acid bacteria – Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium longum), and colchicine. She neither smoked tobacco nor drank alcohol. Her social and environmental history was unremarkable. She had never worked. Her mother had schizophrenia.\nHer vital signs on arrival included blood pressure (BP) of 128/90 mmHg, pulse of 102 beats per minute, regular respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute, blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98% room air, and body temperature of 37.5 °C; she was alert and conscious. She had upper abdominal tenderness with no rebound tenderness. The results of her cardiac, pulmonary, and neurological examinations were unremarkable. Complete blood count, renal function tests, urine analysis, and bacteria tests were normal except for mild hepatic dysfunction and elevated d-dimer levels (Table ). Although colchicine was administered below the lethal dose, she was admitted for observation.\nOn the day after the hospital admission, she developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), thus, tracheal intubation using an artificial ventilator was performed. She also became dehydrated, due to diarrhea, which developed after admission. Peripheral circulatory insufficiency gradually worsened, and large amounts of infusion loads (including blood transfusions) were unable to maintain her BP. Her lactic acid level reached a maximum of 19 mmol/L. At maximum disease severity, she required noradrenaline 1 μg/kg/minute, vasopressin 2 units/hour, steroids 200 mg/day, dopamine 10 μg/kg/minute, dobutamine 4 μg/kg/minute, and adrenaline 0.15 μg/kg/minute to maintain BP. She also showed other organ failures, including worsening hepatic dysfunction after admission with maximum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 16,520 U/L as well as kidney dysfunction with associated anuria. Continuous renal replacement therapy was initiated for anuria and metabolic acidosis. At 36 hours post-admission, her lactic acid level reached its peak, and her hemodynamic reached a level at which she could tolerate water removal. At 72 hours post-admission, she was administered with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor due to the appearance of myelosuppression. In addition to the broad-spectrum antimicrobial administration, she was commenced on a course of antimycotic medication. Table shows the laboratory results of organs function over time.\nApproximately 1 week after admission, her BP could be maintained without the use of vasopressor drugs; however, as she showed poor alert wakefulness, a head computed tomography was performed. The results showed multiple intracranial hemorrhages of up to 12 mm in diameter (Fig. ), thought to be associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). As the disease course progressed, the hematomas were absorbed and our patient was able to respond to verbal commands. Approximately 2 weeks post-admission, she presented with marked hair loss.\nSubsequently, her general condition improved and, at discharge, all organ insufficiency had improved. The progress of her Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores and D-dimer levels are shown in Fig. . She worked hard at rehabilitation. By 6 months after discharge, she had no disorders and had resumed normal life as before her hospitalization.

In both episodes, troponin I was elevated (maximum value 3.1 ng/mL) and slowly declined. In the last episode she took ibuprofen 600 mg every 8h for 2 weeks and colchicine 0.5 mg twice a day for 6 months. Physical activity was restricted for 6 months. Transthoracic echocardiography was normal but cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) performed latter demonstrated residual fibrosis in the lateral wall of left ventricle.\nThe patient remained asymptomatic until June 2017 when she complained of palpitations and mild chest pain. Physical examination, Electrocardiogram (ECG) and transthoracic echocardiography were normal but troponin I was positive (1.04 ng/mL; normal range < 0.04 ng/mL) so myopericarditis was assumed and the patient was admitted\nto the hospital and ibuprofen and colchicines were initiated. The next day and until discharge, troponin I remained negative and the patient was free from symptoms. Serology for virus, interferon gamma release assay and clinical or laboratory tests for autoimmune diseases were all negative. The possibility of a false positive test on admission was thought due to the immediate fall in troponin level. However, owing to the relief of symptoms with medication, myopericarditis could not be excluded and the patient was discharged on ibuprofen and colchicine at the same dose as before.\nThree weeks later she returned to the hospital complaining of similar symptoms. Once again, initial measurement of troponin I was positive (1.31 ng/mL) and incessant myopericarditis was assumed. Physical exam remained unremarkable as well as the ECG and transthoracic echocardiography. During hospitalization, measurements of troponin I remained always negative. She had a cardiac MRI once again but no signals of active myocarditis were detected and residual fibrosis remained as previously described (Fig. ). Once more, a false positive result was a possibility since the first measurements were performed by the emergency laboratory (Beckman Coulter Access AccuTnI+3®) and the next ones by the routine laboratory (Abbott Architect STAT high sensitive TnI®). To rule out a false positive result in the first measurement, performed by emergency laboratory, two samples of blood were collected at the same time and sent to both laboratories. The result was positive in the emergency laboratory (1.03 ng/mL) and negative in the routine laboratory (0.00 ng/mL). Although alkaline phosphatase activity was within the normal range (58 U/L; normal range 40-150 U/L), alkaline phosphatase interference was proved in the Beckman Coulter central laboratory. To demonstrate that, beta human chorionic gonadotropin (βhCG) was measured using the Beckman Coulter Dxl 800 Total β-hCG® (Marseilles, France) assay [] (which is also an alkaline phosphatase dependent immunoassay) and the βhCG was 1.1 IU/L (age-specific reference interval 0-0.6 IU/L []) while using other assay [Siemen´s Vista hCG (Erlanger, Germany)] was 0 IU/L.\nRetrospectively, we confirmed that in the first two admissions, troponin I was elevated in both laboratories (and not substantially higher in one assay relatively to the other) so myopericarditis indeed existed. In order to avoid future hospital admissions, information regarding alkaline phosphatase interference with troponin I and other assays was provided to the patient and added to the patient´s files.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the urgent care, the rapid strep test came back negative. She was then sent home on steroids and azithromycin. She presented to the emergency department two days later with progressively worsening shortness of breath along with sudden onset pleuritic chest pain. Review of systems was remarkable for shortness of breath and chest pain. Vitals showed temperature of 99 °F, blood pressure of 107/66 mm Hg, a pulse of 138/min, respiratory rate of 28/min, and SpO2 of 97%. Physical examination was remarkable for tenderness in the neck, pus formation on the tonsils, and decreased breath sounds. Labs were remarkable for severe thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis with left shift, granulated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), and acute kidney injury (AKI).\nInitial chest X-ray showed bilateral pleural effusions (). Computed tomography (CT) chest without contrast showed bilateral lung nodules and pleural effusions (). Echocardiogram demonstrated small pleural effusion with normal ejection fraction. Bilateral neck ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) neck without contrast did not show jugular vein thrombophlebitis or peritonsillar abscess, although the study was limited due to insertion of bilateral internal jugular (IJ) catheter insertions. Blood cultures were obtained, intravenous fluids were given, and empiric antibiotic therapy was started with intravenous (IV) vancomycin, IV cefepime, and IV doxycycline. The patient became more hypoxic requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation and went into septic shock requiring pressors. An interval chest X-ray demonstrated worsening bilateral effusions (). Her renal function deteriorated requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). She then developed cardiac arrest due to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) following chest compressions, and there was a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Blood culture grew Fusobacterium, and antibiotics were changed to IV meropenem. To drain the empyema, bilateral chest tubes were placed, the sample was cultured, and it was negative for bacterial growth. The patient also had a left-sided pneumothorax, and it was unsure if the cause was secondary to the underlying infection or iatrogenic. She was placed on acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) net protocol following which there was an improvement, and she was eventually weaned off the ventilator. A repeat CT chest abdomen pelvis with contrast 5 days later was ordered which showed septic emboli in the lungs bilaterally, splenic emboli, bilateral loculated empyema, and left adrenal gland hemorrhage ().\nThe patient responded to antibiotics, and she required long-term care at LTACH where she recovered completely.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient's past medical history was significant for psoriasis since age 2, for which she has been getting an association of betamethasone and salicylic acid. The patient also reports a history of functional colopathy for the past 3 months. No other significant history of endocrine or tumoral conditions was reported. The patient has been suffering from recurring episodes of excessive perspiration and palpitations over the past 4 years, associated with other symptoms of hypertension such as headaches and tinnitus. The patient also reported multiple episodes of recurrent right-sided abdominal pain worsening over the past year.\nHer physical exam upon admission was normal with a BMI (Body Mass Index) = 21.8 kg/m2, a BP (blood pressure) = 130/90 mmHg bilaterally (no postural hypotension was noted), and a heart rate (HR) =88 beats per minute (bpm). The cutaneous examination showed facial erythrosis and eczematous lesions of the upper and lower extremities. No pigmentation disorders nor cutaneous superficial neurofibromas were noted. EKG analysis showed a sinus rhythm and a left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed no adrenal abnormalities but a 7.0 x 5.0 cm tissular-like retroperitoneal mass in contact with the abdominal aorta and the inferior vena cava, intimately related and displacing anteriorly the head of the pancreas (). Abdominal MRI and elevated urinary methylated metabolites of catecholamines (Metanephrine = 3.2 μmol / 24h (normal range (NR) 0.2 to 1), Normetanephrine = 47.5 μmol / 24 h (NR: 0.4 to 2.1)) confirmed the diagnosis of catecholamine-secreting retroperitoneal PG.\nTwenty-four hours after admission, the patient developed a cardiogenic shock. Her initial vital signs were as follows: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) = 14 (E4 V4 M6), BP = 82/46 mmHg, HR = 150 bpm, a respiratory rate at 25 cycles per minute with a SpO2 (peripheral oxygen saturation) at 60% with cold distal extremities and cyanosis. Capillary blood glucose was 150 mg/dl. Fluid resuscitation using 500 ml of Ringer Lactate solution and oxygen through high concentration mask were both promptly started and the patient was transferred to the ICU.\nOn admission, clinical assessment showed signs of heart failure, elevated troponin, and lactates markers and an EKG revealed sinus tachycardia with a frequency of 130 bpm. The patient was hypoxic with a SpO2 at 95% under 9 L/min of oxygen. Two right femoral central lines were placed (venous and arterial) and the patient was started on Noradrenalin (at a rate of 0.5 μg/kg/min). An echocardiography revealed a global hypokinesia with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at 15%, requiring the patient to be put on 15 μg/kg/min of Dobutamine as inotropic support.\nSeeing how the patient was in no shape to undergo open surgery, we opted for a preoperative radiological percutaneous transarterial embolization (TAE), under local anesthesia. It consisted of coiling of four major feeding vessels, 2 arising from the right renal artery and 2 more from the lumbar arteries (L2 and L3), using hydrogel with Polyzene®-F coating microparticules (). The patient was gradually weaned off catecholamines during embolization. She was completely weaned off vasoactive drugs in the next 24 hours. 48 hours after embolization, a follow-up echocardiography showed an overall normokinetic left ventricle (LV), an improved FEVG at 50%, and an aortic VTI (velocity time integral) at 20m/s. Lactate levels went back to normal over the next 48 hours. In the postembolization period, the patient experienced several nonsymptomatic hypertension peaks (systolic blood pressure (SBP) = 220mmHg) and received intravenous nicardipine at a rate of 5 mg/H. The extremities warmed up and the daily urine output was maintained.\nThree days after embolization, the patient was taken to the operating room for the tumor to be surgically removed through a right subcostal approach. Perioperative exploration found a retroperitoneal soft encapsulated tumor measuring 7.0 cm in diameter, in intimate contact with the abdominal aorta, the right renal vein, and the inferior vena cava (). Embolization caused no complications. The tumor's adhesions were carefully released from adjacent organs including the right kidney, the duodenum, and the head of the pancreas. There was no need to place a double J ureteral stent preoperatively. Upon manipulation of the mass, there was moderate elevation in the blood pressure that was controlled with intravenous propranolol and nicardipine. A complete resection of the tumor was performed and no adjacent organs were removed or injured during the surgery ().\nThe patient experienced episodes of hypotension after the tumor excision and received intravenous noradrenaline at a rate of 0.3 μg/kg/min. The patient was then transferred back to the ICU and extubated in fast track manner. She was weaned off vasoactive drugs in the following 6 hours.\nsums up the lab work-up of the patient during her stay.\nDuring close ICU monitoring, the patient presented several episodes of hypoglycemia and hypokalemia and was given intravenous supplementation of glucose and potassium. A postoperative echocardiography showed a hyperkinetic myocardium with an enlarged LV, an IVS (interventricular septum) measuring 13 mm, a lateral wall measuring 14 mm, and a much improved LVEF at 70%.\nThe patient was subsequently discharged after spending 4 days in the ICU and transferred to a general surgery service. Pathological report of the tumor mass confirmed the diagnosis of benign extra-adrenal PG. A one-month echocardiography follow-up noted nothing significant. She now completely recovered and is back to her daily life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Physical examination confirmed the presence of left leg swelling with mild erythema below the knee; otherwise, no palpable cords or other abnormalities were seen in her lower extremities. Initially it was thought to be deep venous thrombosis, but there was no evidence via venous Doppler ultrasound. Cardiac examination did not reveal murmurs, rubs, gallops, or other abnormalities, and her lungs were clear to auscultation. Upon questioning her family, it was revealed that a few hours prior to presentation the patient had developed sudden onset of difficulty breathing and subsequent loss of consciousness. She was rushed to the ED.\nFurther workup revealed leukocytosis of 19.84×109 /L, elevated D-dimer of 19.9 milligrams per liter, fibrinogen of 457.9 milligrams per deciliter, and troponin of 2.42 micrograms per liter. An electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed an S1Q3T3 pattern. A urine dipstick revealed +2 protein and was otherwise normal.\nA magnesium sulfate (MGSO4) bolus dose of 4g intravenous (IV) over 30 minutes followed by a drip of 2 grams per hour was initiated for presumed eclampsia. A brain computed tomography (CT) without contrast was ordered for the workup of a first-time seizure. This was unremarkable. At this point, the patient’s differential diagnosis was reconsidered and prompted the team to order a CT venogram (CTV) of the brain with a CT pulmonary angiogram. It demonstrated CVT involving the superior sagittal and right transverse sinuses (), while her CT pulmonary angiogram showed bilateral pulmonary thromboses involving the main, lobar, and multiple segmental arteries bilaterally ().\nEnoxaparin sodium was initiated in the ED and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management. During her ICU stay, brain MRI with a magnetic resonance angiogram showed diffuse ischemia with a 5 mm tonsillar herniation and the absence of signal flow void in both internal carotid arteries (). She was started on 1 g/kg IV of mannitol over 60 minutes. Additionally, a presumptive diagnosis of seronegative antiphospholipid syndrome was made and IV immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone were initiated, with the addition of plasmapheresis. Unfortunately, none of the treatment measures showed a favorable response. Her poor prognosis was discussed with her family and the consensus was to place a do-not-resuscitate order.

Dysmenorrhea, gastrointestinal, or urinary tract symptoms was negative. She had regular menstrual cycles and her body mass index was 26.6. Because of abdominal obesity, we couldn't touch any masses in abdominal exam.\nSince she was virgin, vaginal exam was refused and in rectal exam a large cystic mass with mild tenderness in the right side of pelvis was palpable. Abdominopelvic ultrasonography revealed 14×10 cm complex multiseptate cystic mass containing solid components in the right ovary and a little free fluid in the cul-de-sac. Right ovary and uterus were normal. These data were confirmed in abdominopelvic spiral CT scan with and without contrast.\nComplete laboratory tests including tumor markers requested. All laboratory tests were normal except Lactate dehydrogenase that was 253 (normal upper limit: 280 u/l). In tumor marker panel, alpha fetoprotein, β-HCG, carcinoemberionic antigen (CEA) were in normal range. The serum concentrations of CA-125 and cancer antigen 19-9 were 6484 IU/Ml and 1309 IU/Ml (reference range 35 IU/Ml). Human Epididymis protein 4 (HE4) was 50.7 and Risk of ovarian malignancy algorithm (ROMA) was 11%. CA-125 and CA 19-9 were measured by using appropriate chemiluminescent immunoassay kits (ROSHE Company, ELECSYS 2010 devices).\nAlthough HE4 and ROMA were in low risk for malignancy, because of very high levels of other tumor markers, ovarian malignancies were in the top of the differential diagnosis yet and after achieving written consent about cancer surgery, laparotomy with midline incision was done.

She developed nonocclusive thrombus involving the celiac trunk, proximal hepatic, and splenic arteries shorty after her first pentamidine administration. She originally started intravenous (IV) pentamidine after developing a nonspecific rash (without mucosal involvement) initially attributed to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.\nTwenty minutes into her first administration of IV pentamidine she developed severe crippling abdominal pain, emesis, diarrhea, and light headiness followed by near-syncope. Abdominal X-ray showed non-obstructive gas patterns with small bowel wall thickening. After resolution of her abdominal pain she was given a platelet transfusion for thrombocytopenia (Table ). During the platelet infusion, she developed intense abdominal pain, hypotension, and poor perfusion. Treated with intramuscular epinephrine yielded a positive response.\nAn abdominal CT scan showed colonic wall thickening with surrounding inflammatory changes and concern for ischemic colitis. An MR enterography revealed a nonocclusive thrombus involving the celiac trunk, proximal hepatic, and splenic arteries. The patient underwent a partial colectomy from the mid transverse colon to mid distal colon. The pathology results showed patchy transmural ischemic colitis without evidence of local thrombosis or emboli. Continued treatments of IV pentamidine every 2 weeks were noted to have immediate production of a range of symptoms mostly commonly: abdominal pain, emesis, pruritus (originally urticaria was rarely noted), diarrhea and headaches. Pentamidine allergy was established and desensitization protocol was subsequently used. Isolated urticarial flares with each desensitization was reported without any other clinical systemic involvement.\nCombined using a paired two tailed Wilcoxon test on the Pre- and Post-anaphylactic platelets levels of all 3 case's showed the overall P < 0.0001(Figure ). A Spearman test on the pairing had a rs value of 0.9344 with a P < 0.0001.\nFor Case 3, her platelet count post BMT remained in the low 30–50's. Laboratory analysis of known specific antibodies to platelets were negative. With spacing out her pentamidine treatments to every 4 weeks her counts marginally improved to the 40–60's. Once off pentamidine, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) was restarted. Her thrombocytopenia again incrementally improved to the 80–100's. A Kruskal-Wallis test on her platelet levels with respect to the frequency of her pentamidine infusions and off pentamidine showed a P < 0.0001 (Figure ).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three months prior she had an upper respiratory infection. Her initial workup was unrevealing, including negative troponin and normal complete blood count. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed normal sinus rhythm. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) chest had no significant findings. She was diagnosed with atypical chest pain and discharged home.\nShe returned three days later with worsening chest pain. ECG () was significant for sinus tachycardia, PR depressions, and diffuse ST elevations, consistent with pericarditis. Significant findings at that time included a Troponin-I of 0.28 ng/ml and white blood cell count (WBC) of 16.2 (16,200). Shortly after admission, she was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypotension and tachycardia in the 150 s. Echocardiography demonstrated a moderate pericardial effusion with evidence of tamponade. Pericardiocentesis yielded 300 ml of serous fluid and established hemodynamic stability. She was initiated on empiric antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and meropenem. Later that same day, she underwent emergent intubation and vasopressor support after two separate episodes of ventricular fibrillation and pulseless electrical activity, requiring multiple rounds of advanced cardiac life support. After stabilization, fluid aspiration from the pericardial drain revealed 130 ml of purulent fluid. Her final pericardial fluid cultures and blood cultures grew Streptococcus pyogenes. Antibiotic coverage was weaned to intravenous cefazolin monotherapy. She continued to drain 240–360 milliliters of purulent pericardial fluid daily and was on norepinephrine for pressure support. Post resuscitation, she developed acute renal failure that required intermittent renal replacement therapy secondary to acute tubular necrosis. Antibiotic coverage was broadened to vancomycin and cefepime after the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to multifocal pneumonia. She was gradually weaned from the ventilator and subsequently extubated. The remaining hospital course was uneventful, and she was discharged home on oral levofloxacin for completion of her antibiotic course.\nThe patient returned to the ED several days later with shortness of breath and worsening back pain that radiated to her chest. The ECG () at that time was significant for sinus tachycardia and an S1Q3T3 phenomenon. She was admitted for severe sepsis and started on ceftriaxone for concern of recurrent bacteremia. Repeat transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated right ventricular strain and what appeared to be a near to total occlusion of her pulmonary trunk (). Computed tomography (CT) angiography was significant for a 4.8 cm small-necked pseudoaneurysm arising off the anterolateral aspect of the aorta and was found to be compressing the pulmonary trunk and right pulmonary artery ().\nOur patient was again transferred to the ICU. A subsequent CT chest with contrast demonstrated pseudoaneurysm expansion to 5.3 cm. Emergent cardiothoracic surgery with circulatory arrest was performed. The operation revealed a 2 cm × 1 cm wall defect in the distal ascending aorta, extending into the arch of the aorta. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography revealed right ventricular remodeling resulting in a severely strained D-shaped ventricle and severely dilated RVOT of 4 cm (). Additionally, there was significant clot burden in the anterior mediastinum encasing the ascending aorta and the pulmonary artery. A CorMatrix patch was used to close the defect, and a specimen of the anterior mediastinal mass was sent for pathological analysis, confirming our diagnosis of a mycotic pseudoaneurysm. The patient tolerated the surgical procedure well and did not require additional operations during her inpatient hospital recovery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On physical examination, there was moderate swelling at the old fracture site. There were no signs of local or systemic inflammation. Conventional radiographs of the left forearm revealed a lucent area adjacent to the previous fracture site with surrounding sclerosis and cortical thickening (). Subsequent MRI showed an oval intracortical lesion in the ulna, with central hypointensity to skeletal muscle on both T1 and T2 weighted images. After administration of gadolinium contrast, there was marked peripheral enhancement of the lesion with perilesional bone marrow and soft-tissue oedema ().

The patient gave a history of trauma five years back with occasional pus discharge from the gingiva in relation to maxillary right and left central incisor tooth #11 and tooth #21. Medical history was noncontributory. Clinical examination revealed an enamel fracture in relation to tooth #11 and a discolored tooth with enamel–dentin–pulp fracture in relation to tooth #21 (a). As the prognosis of tooth #21 was guarded and the regenerative procedure was attempted in tooth #11, this case report will further describe about tooth #11 only. The tooth was not tender to palpation and percussion tests. Sensitivity tests with cold and electric pulp testing was negative. There was no evidence of swelling or a sinus tract. The mobility was within the physiological limits. Radiographic evaluation of tooth #11 revealed an immature apex with thinned out root dentin near the apex of the root with periapical radiolucency (b,c). A cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) Promax 3D (Planmeca, Helsinki, Finland) with a limited field of view (FOV) of 3 × 3 cm was taken to aid in diagnosis and treatment planning. By using an inbuilt software program (Planmeca Romexis software V3.5.1, Planmeca, Helsinki, Finland), various linear dimensions were recorded in millimeters. The root length was 7.4 mm. The root dentin thickness in the axial section measured 1.2 mm labially, 0.8 mm mesially, 0.8 mm lingually, and 0.8 mm distally, respectively (a,b). The volume of periapical lesion was measured using a Volux–Horos viewer for Mac (V2.0.2, Nimble Co., LLC d/p/a Purview, Annapolis, MD, USA), and a CBCT periapical index (CBCTPAI) score of 5D was assigned to tooth #11 (f,h,j,l). A diagnosis of an immature tooth with pulp necrosis and asymptomatic apical periodontitis in relation to tooth #11 arrived.\nA regenerative procedure was planned for tooth #11 using HAM as scaffold. The patient was explained about the extensive use of HAM in clinical scenarios [] and its use in a root canal is off-label. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient after a thorough explanation of treatment procedure. Tooth #11 was anesthetized with 2% lidocaine with adrenaline (Xylocaine, AstraZenecaPharma India Pvt. Ltd., Bangalore, India) and isolated with rubber dam (Dental Dam, Coltène Whaledent, Langenau, Germany). The tooth #11 was accessed with round bur (Dia-burs, Mani Inc., Tochigi, Japan). The working length was determined by electronic apex locator (Root ZX; J Morita MFQ, Kyoto, Japan) and confirmed by taking a digital periapical radiograph (Satelec India Pvt Ltd., Acteon Group, the Hague, the Netherlands). Minimal instrumentation of the root canal was performed by circumferential filing with #80 K file in relation to #11. The canals were gently irrigated with 20 mL of 1% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) (Parcan; Septodont, Saint-Maur, France) using EndoVac (Discus Dental, Culver City, CA, USA). The canal was dried with sterile absorbent points (Dentsply Maillefer, Baillaigues, Switzerland). The interappointment medication of calcium hydroxide (Prime Dental products, Mumbai, India) was placed inside the canal and then temporized with cavit (3 M, St Paul, MN, USA).\nThe patient was recalled after four weeks and was asymptomatic in relation to #11. The access cavity was reopened under rubber dam isolation. Calcium hydroxide was removed with saline using passive ultrasonic irrigation (Satelec, Acteon group, Merignac, France). Final disinfection was performed with 20 mL of 1% NaOCl and 20 mL of 17% ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Dent Wash, Prime Dental products, Thane, India) using EndoVac. The canal was dried with sterile absorbent points. The commercially available processed freeze-dried irradiated human amniotic membrane (ACTREC, Tata memorial hospital tissue bank, Mumbai, India) was cut into small pieces and moistened with saline. The membrane was packed inside the canal incrementally with finger plugger in the apical portion of the canal. ACTREC is the first tissue bank in India to use radiation for the sterilization of biological tissues with an ISO 9001:2000 Certified Quality Management System. The processing of amnion tissue in Tata Memorial Hospital is carried out according to the guidelines of the American Association of Tissue Banks []. BiodentineTM (Septodont, Saint-Maur, France) was then placed in the coronal third of the root canal and the access was sealed with glass ionomer cement (Fuji IX, GC, Tokyo, Japan) and resin composite (d,e).\nThe patient was asymptomatic when reviewed after 15 days in relation to tooth #11. At the three-month follow up, the patient was asymptomatic with no signs of swelling or sinus tracts in relation to #11 (f). The patient was lost to follow up and returned to the clinic at 19 months. The patient was assessed at 19 months (g) and at 36 months (h) wherein the patient continued to be asymptomatic in relation to tooth #11. The patient responded to electric pulp vitality and cold testing methods, which was reproducible multiple times. The intra oral radiographic examination revealed healing of periapical lesion, thickening of dentinal walls as well as a mineralized dentin bridge formation over Biodentine™ (f).\nA postoperative CBCT was performed for the evaluation of treatment outcome. The post-operative reduction of volume of periapical lesion was assessed using a Volux—Horos viewer for Mac (V2.0.2). The CBCT images of #11 revealed a reduction in size of periapical radiolucency, a thickening of the root canal wall and deposition of the mineralized layer in close approximation to Biodentine™ (c,d,e,g,i,k,m).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Her main symptom was gingival swelling in the region of her upper right anterior teeth. She had no medical, family and psychosocial history, and she had not undergone relevant past interventions. A physical examination showed no problems. She had previously undergone root canal treatment for the remaining deciduous canine because of pus discharging from the root canal. An intraoral examination revealed a diffuse swelling around the deciduous canine, midline diastema, and tooth crowding. A panoramic radiograph revealed a round radiolucency with a diameter of 30 mm, with well-demarcated margins around the maxillary canine (Fig. ). Computed tomography (CT) revealed that the cystic cavity surrounded the maxillary canine and was filled with a homogeneous water-like fluid with density (Fig. ). Our clinical diagnosis was maxillary dentigerous cyst with an unerupted maxillary canine. Marsupialization was carried out under general anesthesia, and the unerupted canine was left in place (Fig. ). A histopathological examination revealed the diagnosis of dentigerous cyst. However, the marsupialization did not result in eruption of the canine. Three months later, orthodontic traction was applied to the unerupted canine, and simultaneously orthodontic treatment to correct the tooth crowding and midline diastema (Fig. ). The orthodontic traction of the maxillary canine failed, and the canine was then extracted. On the other hand, crowding and midline diastema were improved (Fig. ). The revised treatment plan was to undertake staged implant placement, because the alveolar bone at the implant site was inadequate, 2 mm alveolar width on CT (Fig. ). We were planning to bone graft after the mucosa completely healed up because severe scar tissue caused by the previous marsupialization was seen in the canine tooth extraction area. Bone augmentation was performed with an autogenous bone graft that was harvested from the mandibular ramus to widen the alveolar bone (Fig. ). While doing the implant placement in the second operation, a part of the grafted bone was exposed, and was trimmed with a bur, several times (Fig. ). The wound had completely healed up in 6 months. For her busy schedule, 11 months after the bone graft, the implant was inserted without any problems. The implant was uncovered, and the abutment was connected under local anesthesia (Fig. ). The occlusion was stabilized by the implant, following a screw-retained prosthodontic procedure performed with appropriate implant stability. The occlusion was successfully restored by the insertion of the implant (Table ). Good clinical results were achieved with no severe complications or recurrence of the cyst (Fig. ). Her postoperative course was uneventful for 7 years. A CT scan taken 7 years after marsupialization showed that the cystic cavity had been replaced by new bone, and that the implant was stable in the surrounding bone (Figs. , ).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She reported that elevated transaminases had been noted during a recent visit with her endocrinologist. Her CBC included a WBC count of 8,600 mm3, hemoglobin of 12.4 g/dl (MCV 77.8 fL), and platelet count of 261,000 mm3. Ferritin was markedly elevated (1229.6 ng/mL); serum iron, TIBC, and iron saturation were decreased, suggestive of anemia of chronic disease. AST was elevated to 127 units/mL, and ALT was elevated to 239 units/mL. Hemoglobin electrophoresis revealed normal adult hemoglobin. A rapid HIV test was nonreactive. PCR testing of peripheral blood was negative for EBV and HHV-6. Multiple blood cultures were negative.\nAbdominal ultrasound showed splenomegaly and enlarged porta hepatis lymph nodes. A PET scan revealed diffuse hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy involving cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, pelvic, and inguinal nodes, as well as findings consistent with malignant infiltration of the bilateral kidneys and spleen (). Although the possibility of a drug reaction had been in the differential diagnosis prior to the imaging studies, the degree and extent of the imaging abnormalities raised clinical concern for a malignant process.\nDue to the concern for malignancy, axillary lymph node and bone marrow biopsies were performed. Examination of the bone marrow showed that it was appropriately cellular for age (∼80%), with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis, polyclonal plasmacytosis, and eosinophilia. Scattered small T-cell aggregates were present. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping did not detect any abnormal lymphoid populations. No evidence of malignancy was identified.\nHistologic examination of the lymph node revealed mostly preserved, but significantly distorted, nodal architecture with expansion of the paracortex by a mixed infiltrate of small lymphocytes, eosinophils, histiocytes, plasma cells, and scattered large atypical lymphoid cells, including occasional Reed–Sternberg-like cells. Secondary follicles were largely absent (Figures and ). A few apoptotic bodies and pigment-containing histiocytes were identified.\nImmunohistochemical stains for CD20, PAX5, CD79a, OCT2, and BOB-1 highlighted the B-cell population in the cortex that was largely confined to primary follicles. CD23 highlighted irregularly expanded follicular dendritic cell meshworks. CD3 highlighted numerous T cells in the paracortex and interfollicular areas. CD15 highlighted granulocytes. CD30 highlighted scattered large immunoblasts, including rare Reed–Sternberg-like cells (); no sheets of positive cells were seen. MUM1 was positive in plasma cells, predominantly in the medullary cords and sinuses. ALK immunostaining and EBV in situ hybridization (EBER) were negative.\nThe lymph node findings, including architectural distortion, expanded follicular dendritic cell meshworks, eosinophilic infiltrate, and proliferation of large CD30-positive lymphoid cells raised concern for a malignant process such as T-cell lymphoma or classic Hodgkin's lymphoma; however, the morphologic and immunophenotypic features were not entirely typical for those diagnoses. Molecular analysis of the lymph node did not detect any monoclonal IGH or IGK gene rearrangement or T-cell receptor gene rearrangement.\nTwo days after the lymph node biopsy was performed, the patient's WBC count had risen to 24,100/mm3. Examination of the peripheral blood smear revealed neutrophilia, atypical lymphocytes, and mild relative eosinophilia, with an increased absolute eosinophil count of 1,400/mm3. On further review of the patient's history, it was noted that the patient had received a course of minocycline to treat folliculitis, beginning approximately five weeks prior to admission and ending four days prior to admission.\nAfter consideration of all of the available information, a diagnosis of DIHS was made. The minocycline was discontinued permanently. Following treatment with prednisone, the patient's rash, leukocytosis, and lymphadenopathy gradually resolved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was no significant past illness. There was no history of significant weight loss, cough, orthopnea, pain abdomen. On physical examination, she was febrile, pale, and icteric. The spleen was palpable 2 cm below the left costal margin. Her pulse rate was 102/minute with a blood pressure of 106/70 mmHg.\nA complete blood count (CBC) revealed severe anemia (hemoglobin—5.8 g/dl, mean corpuscular volume (MCV)—92 fl) with a platelet count of 148 × 103/µL and white blood cell count (WBC) of 3.37 × 103/µL. A peripheral blood smear showed few spherocytes, nucleated red blood cells. Biochemistry showed indirect hyperbilirubinemia with high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH—1540 IU/L). On further investigations, corrected reticulocyte count was 5.4%. A direct Coombs test was strongly positive (4+). Based on initial investigations, we made an initial diagnosis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Viral markers (HIV, HBs Ag, anti-HCV) were negative. Serology for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and mycoplasma was also negative. Antinuclear antibodies were absent. Our patient remained febrile during hospitalisation, which was not explained by hemolytic anemia; on further evaluation, there was a recent history of consumption of unpasteurized milk. Since Brucella is one of the common zoonotic diseases in western India, we suspected brucellosis. The serology for brucellosis was positive in high titre (standard agglutination test—1:640). The diagnosis was confirmed with positive blood culture for Brucella melitensis. We made a final diagnosis of acute brucellosis with Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia.

Physical and ultrasound examination showed increased spleen size (+0.2 dm). Laboratory data showed significant leukocytosis (26.8 × 109/μL) and basophilia (20%). According to these indicators, accelerated phase of CML has been diagnosed, after cytogenetic analysis Ph-chromosome was detected in all bone marrow myeloid cells (BMC). After 6 months of chemotherapy with hydrea and idarubicin, patient has been receiving imatinib 400 mg/d the first month, 600 mg/d for 2 following months, and 800 mg/d for 8 following years. Significant cytogenetic response (20% Ph+ bone marrow cells) and optimal molecular response (BCR-ABL/ABL ratio = 9.43%) were achieved by the end of the first year but cytogenetic (CyR) and molecular responses were lost after 18 months of treatment with imatinib (CyR = 43% Ph+ cells, BCR-ABL/ABL = 51.77%). After 8 years of treatment, the hematologic response was lost (basophilia more than 20%), Ph-chromosome was detected in 67% of cells, the BCR-ABL/ABL ratio was 75.81%, and also cDNA direct sequencing revealed M351T mutation.\nIn 2009, bosutinib therapy had been started, and after the first month of treatment with 500 mg/d, cytogenetic response had been 55% Ph+ cells and molecular response had been 62.34%, but after 3 months, it was lost (CyR = 67%; BCR-ABL/ABL = 88.44%) and the dosage was increased to 600 mg/d no effect.\nIn 2013, direct Sanger sequencing of cDNA revealed two transcript types: “wild-type” BCR-ABL without point mutations and truncated transcript with combination of del. c.1086-1270 and mutation c.893T>G (p.L298R). Dasatinib therapy (140 mg/d) was initiated but discontinued after 3 years because of significant thrombocytopenia (15.4 × 109 platelets/dL) and absence of molecular and cytogenetic (after first month of treatment—CyR = 31%, BCR-ABL/ABL = 56.84%; after 3 years—CyR = 100%, BCR-ABL/ABL = 125.39%).\nIn this way, it was decided to conduct fragment analysis and direct Sanger sequencing to identify point mutations. In 2016, cDNA fragment analysis has also detected two transcript types, and after their sequencing, I found that truncated transcript with del. c.1086-1270 (Figure ) and c.893T>G (p.L298R) has acquired a novel mutation c.844G>C p.E282Q which has not been described so far. Interestingly, point mutations were absent in normal length BCR-ABL transcript (Figure ).\nAccording to these data, it was decided to offer the patient to participate in a Phase I clinical trial of a novel third generation BCR-ABL TKI PF-114 mesylate. Initial dose was 50 mg/d for the first month and now she receives dose 300 mg/d.\nNext I decided to estimate the frequency of occurrence of exon 7 deletion among the patients of our center. A total of 33 male and 49 female CML patients (age 24-80) with BCR-ABL transcript level >0.1% were included in the study. Initial screening for deletions was performed by cDNA fragment analysis (Applied Biosystems 3130). BCR-ABL del. c.1086-1270 was estimated by nested PCR followed by Sanger sequencing. Deletion was found in 32 patients (39%). Fifteen of 32 (47%) patients with deletion were TKI sensitive and did not have additional point mutations while 17 (53%) were TKI resistant. All patients in the TKI-resistant group had a history of proven resistance to at least one inhibitor, while 12 of 17 these patients did not have point mutations associated with resistance, and in 5 other patients, the following mutations were detected only in the deleted transcript (transcript with del. c.1086-1270): F317V, F317L, E282Q, M351T, T315I, while they were absent in normal length transcripts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there was no blurring of vision, eye discharge or itchiness. She is a cat lover and had been caring for her sick cat. Despite veterinary care, her cat subsequently died because of sporotrichosis infection. However, she denied any history of a cat scratch, trauma, or contact with organic matter. She also denied any fever, skin infection, or respiratory symptoms.\nOn examination, the patient’s visual acuity was found to be 6/9 in both eyes. Her left eye showed conjunctival hyperemia with generalized granulomatous lesions over the superior and inferior palpebral conjunctiva (Figure ). The granulomatous conjunctival lesions were covered with thin whitish discharge. The cornea was normal, as was the anterior chamber. Posterior segment was likewise unremarkable. Systemic examination revealed a swollen and painful left cervical lymph node measuring about 1 x 2 cm. The patient was afebrile. There was no evidence of cutaneous fungal infection. An excisional biopsy of the left eye inferior conjunctival fornix lesion was performed. The patient was started on guttate fluconazole q1h and guttate ciprofloxacin q2h on the left eye while waiting for the tissue histopathology and culture results. Tissue specimen identified numerous granulomas with few fungal yeasts engulfed by histiocytes. Culture of the tissue isolated S. schenckii. The topical fluconazole and ciprofloxacin were stopped and the patient was treated with oral itraconazole 200 mg twice daily for six months.

Radiographs showed bilateral DDH type III Crowe classification (). There was no leg length discrepancy due to bilateral pathology. On preoperative templating, by placing the acetabular component in the true acetabulum, planned limb lengthening was 4 cm.\nThe THA was performed using a posterior approach. A 42 mm monobloc acetabular cup (Zimmer Maxera; Zimmer Biomet, Warsaw, IN, USA) was placed in the true acetabulum to restore the hip center of rotation. The cup used is a monobloc, uncemented implant with a non-modular ceramic liner (Biolox Delta; CeramTec, Plochingen, Germany). Matching ceramic femoral head size was 32 mm. With medialization, cup coverage was sufficient without the requirement for bone graft. The femoral stem was a straight conical uncemented stem (Zimmer Wagner cone prosthesis).\nDuring the procedure, the surgeon (AR) noted a tight sciatic nerve, but thought it was acceptable and no femoral shortening was performed. Neither electromyographic monitoring nor wake-up tests are commonly used in our practice. On the day following surgery, the patient had paresthesia in the sciatic nerve distribution but motor function was intact. The postoperative radiographs () showed a 5.5 cm leg lengthening which was thought to be the cause of the sciatic nerve paresthesia. As there was no motor palsy, the initial diagnosis was a neurapraxia. Therefore, the patient was monitored to see if there was any recovery of nerve function. During the next 5 weeks, there was no improvement of the symptoms with a persistence of paresthesia when the knee was in full extension. A diagnosis of axonotmesis was made and the decision was taken to perform a femoral osteotomy to reduce the nerve tension and potentially favor nerve recovery. To avoid compromising the stability of the hip reconstruction surgery, a distal femoral osteotomy was seen as a better option.\nAt 6 weeks after the initial surgery, the distal femoral osteotomy procedure was performed (3 cm shortening). Within the immediate days after the osteotomy, there was a significant reduction in pain and paresthesia. Complete recovery of sciatic nerve function was obtained within 6 weeks. The osteotomy was fully united by 3 -months. At 6-year follow-up, the patient remains asymptomatic with excellent hip function, no pain or dislocation, and normal motion.\n2 years after the left THA, the patient requested surgery for her right hip. At the time of surgery on that side, a distal femoral osteotomy was performed in the same setting, immediately prior to the THA (3 cm shortening). The THA was uncomplicated, with importantly no sciatic nerve problems postoperatively ().",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blood samples showed high levels of thyroperoxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies and normal calcitonin serum levels. The patient was euthyroid with normal serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (FT3), and free thyroxine (FT4) during replacement therapy with L-T4. At physical examination, a palpable nodule of ~2 cm in size was detected in the isthmus of the thyroid. There were no palpable cervical lymph-nodes. An US evaluation confirmed an isolated lesion located in the isthmus, showing an isoechoic solid nodule with smooth margins; its size was 18 × 13 × 6 mm with intra and perilesional vascularity (Figure ). Therefore, a FNA was performed and cytological results revealed a TIR3A lesion. The cytological specimen showed an increased cellularity with some microfollicular structures in the background of scant colloid (Figure ). Thus, we assessed the risk factors associated with the isolated TIR 3A nodule of our patient. According to the ATA guidelines we repeated the FNA which confirmed the same result (TIR3A). The second US (after 6 months) showed that there were no clear signs suggesting malignancy such as microcalcifications or taller than wide-shaped nodules. However, we found a small hypoechoic cranial component in the nodule with blurred margins and elastography revealed an increased stiffness in this cranial component. No nodules were detected in the contralateral lobes by US; cervical lymph nodes were normal. Among the possible risk factors, our patient referred a familial history of thyroid cancer. Her mother was submitted to total thyroidectomy for a follicular variant of PTC twenty years ago; our subsequent evaluation showed that she was disease free at the moment.\nOn this basis, we decided that a surgical treatment was indicated for our patient and assessed the risk/benefit of total thyroidectomy vs. isthmusectomy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Before she was admitted to our hospital on June 14, 2017, she had amenorrhea for 2 months. Her medical history was unremarkable. During hospitalization, her blood pressure (BP) and blood glucose remained normal (BP: 134/88mmHg, fasting blood glucose 4.8mmol/L). Her body mass index was 26.6 kg/m2. Plasma cortisol concentrations were 20.67 μg/dL in the morning [8am, 571.3nmol/L, normal: 4.4-19.9 μg/dL (121.6-550.0 nmol/L)], 17.67 μg/dL in the afternoon (4pm, 488.7nmol/L) and 18.95 μg/dL in the midnight (0am, 523.8nmol/L), indicated that the normal circadian rhythm was lost. The morning, afternoon and midnight plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentration was 1.32 pg/mL (normal: 7.2–63.3pg/mL), 1.37pg/mL, and 1.01pg/mL, respectively. Urinary free cortisol (UFC) concentration was 1824 μg/24 h (normal: 100-379 μg/24 h). During the low dose dexamethasone depression test (LDDST), the morning plasma cortisol slightly increased from 20.67 μg/dL to 25.66 μg/dL, and the UFC after oral dexamethasone was 1388.8 μg/24 h. The patient underwent a high dose dexamethasone suppression test (HDDST), the morning plasma cortisol was 27.52 μg/dL and UFC was 1726.1 μg/24 h after oral dexamethasone intervention. Both morning plasma cortisol and UFC in LDDST and HDDST were not suppressed, supporting the diagnosis of ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome. Adrenal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a well-circumscribed round mass with a maximum diameter of 3.0 cm in the left renal hilum, and bilateral adrenal glands were atrophic (Fig. A, Fig. B). The tumor was clinically suspected as ectopic adrenal cortical adenoma. Ultrasound of obstetrics and gynecology was performed to rule out other possible ectopic adrenal rests, and the ultrasound indicated polycystic ovaries (over 12 cysts for each ovary).\nThe patient underwent laparoscopic resection of the tumor. During the operation, the mass in the left renal hilum was completely resected. Postoperative pathology results confirmed the diagnosis of ectopic adrenocortical adenoma.

Her radiographs with the spine demonstrated that the Cobb angle of lumbar scoliosis was 105° (Thoracic 11 to Lumbar 4) and the distance of trunk shift was 10 cm. The kyphosis angle from T8 to L3 was 58° (Fig. ).\nAt birth, the patient was noted to have hemihypertrophy and hemangioma on her face and back. Abnormal asymmetric growth became apparent along with her age. She underwent laser therapy for her facial hemangioma at the age of 4. Three years ago, venous varicosities appeared on both lower extremities. Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome (KTS) was diagnosed for her. In addition, the patient had a history of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) at birth. However, the Apgar score was unclear. Her mother took some medicine for cold at her 8th week of pregnancy.\nThere was no family history of KTS.\nPhysical examination showed hemihypertrophy of the left face, trunk, lower limb (Fig. ). There was a port-wine stain on her back (Fig. ) and venous varicosities on both lower limbs (Fig. ). Her left tonsil was swollen in 3 degrees. Her left leg was 2 cm longer than the right side. Obvious claudication was noted when she walked. Neurological examination was intact.\nPositive laboratory examination results included an increased D-Dimer level of 2.02 mg/L (0~0.55, FEU), decreased hemoglobin level of 105 g/L (110–150 g/L), decreased 1,25(OH)2D3 level of 6.58 pg/mL (19.6~54.3 pg/mL), decreased Fe level of 34.7μg/dL (50~170 μg/dL), and decreased ferritin (Fer) level of 8 ng/mL (14~307 ng/mL). Thyroid function test showed increased TSH of 6.669 μIU/mL, A-Tg of 189.20 IU/mL, and A-TPO of 297.50 IU/mL. The fecal occult blood test was negative.\nA computed tomographic (CT) scan of spine revealed no vertebral body deformities. Doppler ultrasound scan found no significant arteriovenous shunting. A magnetic resonance imaging of the spine showed Chiari-I-malformation without syringomyelia.\nWe had a consultation with endocrinologist and hematologist. However, the relation between kyphoscoliosis and other comorbidities could not be determined. Vitamin D deficiency, like other comorbidities, might be due to innutrition. Oral ferrous succinate and cholecalciferol cholesterol emulsion were administrated preoperatively. As a result, her Hemoglobin, Fe, and Fer regained normal value before surgery. However, her 1,25(OH)2D3 level was 5.21 pg/mL, which was still lower than the normal value. Subcutaneous injection of low molecular weight heparin was conducted preoperatively and maintained two weeks postoperatively. The dynamic change of D-Dimer level was shown in Fig. . Finally, posterior scoliosis correction and spinal fusion from T10 to L5 levels were performed. During surgery, we found that the scoliosis was very rigid and blood oozing from the wound surface was obvious. Bone quality was similar to other adolescent patients during pedicle screw implantation, although the patient had Vitamin D deficiency. Left pedicle of T10 poorly developed and we failed to place left pedicle screw of T10. The total operation time was about 5 hours and the amount of blood loss was 1300 mL. The motor evoked potential signal of the spinal cord was normal during the operation. Postoperative plain X-ray film demonstrated the Cobb angle of lumbar curve corrected from 105° to 60° (correction rate 43%) and the distance of trunk shift decreased from 10 cm to 1.4 cm (Fig. ). The kyphosis angle decreased from 58° to 26°. No thrombotic events or other complications occurred during perioperative period. At the 3rd month follow-up, there was no change of the curve in the coronal and sagittal planes (Fig. ). At the 8th month follow-up, the Cobb angle in the coronal and sagittal planes was 54° and 34°, respectively. The trunk shift was 1.5 cm in the coronal plane, which was not significantly different from that of postoperative (Fig. ). During the 31-month follow-up, the patient did not experience any discomfort. And her general appearance did not have any change until the last follow-up.

However, imaging studies failed to reveal metastatic lesions. In 1984, she underwent a bilateral total adrenalectomy for bilateral pheochromocytoma through an abdominal approach. Multiple small nodules were found on her liver surface, a biopsy of which showed metastatic medullary carcinoma. In 1987, she underwent a completion thyroidectomy and left modified neck dissection and extirpation of an enlarged parathyroid gland for recurrent MTC and the appearance of primary hyperparathyroidism. In 2014, at 63 years old, she was asymptomatic with elevated serum calcitonin (3900 pg/ml) and CEA (177 ng/ml) levels.

Despite several attempts to re-schedule her therapy appointments around her work schedule, the therapist’s office did not return her calls. The patient also revealed that a supportive stepfather lived nearby. The morning of her ED visit, she received another reminder about her tuition bill. She was talking with a roommate about this bill; however, she felt her roommate did not fully appreciate her challenges, and she then called her mother.\nThe psychiatrist and patient agreed all this would be stressful for anyone. Her affect evolved from tearful to more composed, and she identified some immediate goals: find a new therapist; talk with her school about a tuition grant; identify a tutor; and spend more time doing things she enjoys (). She agreed to let the resident call her mother who could help complete these tasks. The patient’s mother corroborated the patient’s history. In fact, the mother had already spoken with the school about help with tuition and had begun searching for new outpatient providers.\nTo complete discharge planning, a nurse made an appointment for the patient with a new outpatient provider. The patient completed a written safety plan and was offered a follow-up call. The family was apprised of local crisis resources. Within an hour, the evaluating psychiatrist felt that this patient’s acute risk was significantly mitigated through safety planning, mobilization of social supports, connection to treatment, and acute de-escalation to justify discharge. After six months, she had persistent resolution of suicidal thoughts without recurrent self-harm or inpatient hospitalization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On examination, she was pale and her spleen was palpable. Her complete blood count revealed hemoglobin (Hb) of 11.2 gm/dI, total leukocyte count (TLC) of 52,300/mm3, and platelet count of 8000/mm3; her differential leukocyte count showed promyelocytes 79%. In Figure , the bone marrow aspiration showed blasts and abnormal promyelocytes 85%, and Auer rods were positive. The histochemical stain was positive for Sudan black, whereas erythropoiesis and myelopoiesis were depressed. The bone marrow trephine biopsy revealed sheets of blasts and abnormal promyelocytes consistent with acute promyelocytic leukemia (FAB AML M3 (French-American-British acute myeloid leukemia type 3)).\nMolecular genetics, including the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for AML gene markers and PCR for FLT3 ITD (Fms like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication) mutations, were negative. The TP53 gene mutation by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was negative. Immunophenotyping for acute leukemia was done, but the report was insufficient in its description. Cytogenetics showed that a culture of lymphocytes at 37oC failed to yield any growth. Promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RARA) translocation by PCR was done, which was not detected.\nWe gave induction chemotherapy (3+7 regimen). On Day 16, her complete blood count (CBC) showed improvement with hemoglobin (Hb) 11.4 gm/dI, white blood cell (WBC) 5,100/mm3, and platelet count 240,000/mm3. The bone trephine procedure was done on post-induction Day 28, in which the bone marrow aspirate showed tri-lineage hematopoiesis, with a prominent increase in erythroid precursors and an increase in mast cells that constituted around 7% of the total nucleated non-erythroid population. These mast cells were spindle-shaped with centric to eccentric nuclei with clumped chromatin and absent nucleoli. They were also present in aggregates with erythroid precursors and prominent in the spicules. Blast cells were less than 5%. Bone trephine (hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)) section showed overall cellularity of around 55% to 60%. Cellular areas exhibited tri-lineage hematopoiesis alternating with areas of dense aggregates/sheets of atypical/immature mast cells. Immunohistochemical stains of mast cell aggregates were CD117 positive. Toluidine blue in the mast cell aggregates was metachromatic positive. Overall, the post-induction bone marrow (BM)/trephine biopsy showed a clearance of blast cells and increased mastocytes, which was suggestive of systemic mastocytosis with an associated hematologic neoplasm (SM-AHN, systemic mastocytosis with associated acute myeloid leukemia (SM-AML)) according to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2016 classification of hematolymphoid neoplasms.\nBut clinically, according to updated WHO diagnostic criteria for systemic mastocytosis 2017, we cannot confirm the diagnosis of SM-AHN, as the mast cells were 7% in our patient while the criteria are >25%, and investigations like KIT-D816V or other activating point mutations of KIT and serum tryptase levels were also not available in our country. We started consolidation chemotherapy of the patient with high-dose cytarabine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She was a student with no employment history. Her height was 156 cm and weight was 55 kg. Her consciousness was normal and there were no neurological abnormalities. She had been receiving antihistamines for atopic dermatitis but had no other conditions, such as neuropathy or hematuria, which would lead us to suspect neuritis or vasculitis. She had no history of tobacco smoking or alcohol consumption. Moreover, there was nothing of note in her family history.\nOn physical examination, palpation revealed a flat abdomen with tenderness in the upper umbilical region, and no signs of peritoneal irritation. Her temperature was 36.3 °C, blood pressure was 159/123 mmHg, pulse was 85 beats/minute, and oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. Her blood laboratory findings revealed a white blood cell count of 8600/mm3 and a C-reactive protein level of 0.12 mg/dL, which was not suggestive of an inflammatory process. However, an increased D-dimer level of 4.36 μg/mL was noted. Her renal and liver functions were normal (blood urea nitrogen 9 mg/dL, creatinine 0.4 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 31 U/L, and alanine aminotransferase 21 U/L). An abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed emphysema of the wall of her small intestine with poor contrast enhancement that corresponded to the area of tenderness (Fig. ). However, the contrast CT revealed heterogeneous contrast enhancement, leading to a suspicion of renal infarction (Fig. ). Necrosis of the small intestine was suspected based on the imaging findings, and urgent surgery was performed.\nLaparotomy revealed an area of necrosis 20 cm in length, which was approximately 100 cm away from the Treitz ligament of the jejunum. There were no findings of strangulation, which precluded the identification of the cause of the necrosis (Fig. ). Since there was no palpable pulse over the arteries surrounding the necrotized intestine, the necrotized regions were resected and the small intestine reconstructed to maintain a palpable pulse.\nAfter surgery, a thrombotic lesion was suspected and anticoagulant therapy with heparin sodium at 20,000 U/day was started. However, pathological findings showed active vasculitis associated with fibrinoid necrosis, as well as destruction, fibrogenesis, and luminal stenosis of the elastic lamina in the muscular arteries. Our patient was therefore diagnosed as having PAN-induced necrosis of the small intestine (Fig. ). Other postoperative investigations included a blood test, which showed that she was negative for proteinase 3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) and hepatitis B surface antigen, but weakly positive for myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA (5.3 U/mL; normal range, 0.0–3.4 U/mL). A postoperative angiograph of her renal arteries demonstrated multiple aneurysms in the renal arterioles. Postoperative urine analysis was positive for proteinuria. Anticoagulant therapy was discontinued, and she was administered 40 mg of prednisolone daily starting on postoperative day 11. Since she continued to improve, the dose of prednisolone was reduced. It has been a year since the surgery, and she is receiving prednisolone at 5 mg a day without recurrence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Her respiratory failure had advanced, so that a supplemental oxygen therapy and night-time non-invasive ventilation were initiated. Bilateral pneumothoraxes with subcutaneous emphysema were detected on an elective control in March 2015. At that time, her FEV1 had decreased to 1.35 L (34% of predicted). She was referred to the respiratory department where her ventilatory failure acutely progressed. After a short resuscitation she was connected to ventilator and subsequently to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). She was listed for a Scandinavian emergency LT. S. apiospermum was detected in fungal culture of the tracheal aspirate with susceptibility testing showing minimal inhibitory concentrations of: voriconazole 0.125mg/L, itraconazole 6mg/L, posaconazole 6mg/L and amphotericin B 12mg/L. After five days on ECMO, she underwent a bilateral LT (defined as day 0). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. apiospermum colonizations were detected in the extracted native lungs. The peri-operative course was complicated by pseudomonas septicemia which was treated with intravenous (IV) tazobactam/piperacillin, tobramycin, and oral ciprofloxacin with a good clinical outcome. IV caspofungin was started postoperatively for antifungal prophylaxis with a single loading dose of 70mg, followed by 50mg daily for 17 days.\nHer baseline immunosuppression regimen consisted of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisolone. Prophylactic valganciclovir, azithromycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and nebulized colistin and amphotericin B were initiated.\nThe first postoperative bronchoscopy at day 30 postoperatively revealed normal anastomotic healing process and otherwise unremarkable endobronchial findings. Bacterial and fungal cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were negative. Histological acute minimal rejection (A1B1) was detected in transbronchial lung biopsy (TBB). The patient was not treated with additional corticosteroids considering her good clinical condition and previous infections and colonizations.\nAt the second control visit 60 days postoperatively, she presented with upper back pain that radiated to the left leg. Symmetric, painful, palpable, and slightly pigmented nodules with small ulcerations had appeared on both legs (). The surgical wound had started to secrete. She had no fever. Her C-reactive protein was 31 mg/l, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 58 mm/h and leukocyte level 9.8 E9/l. Systemic fungal infection was suspected, and IV voriconazole was initiated at 300mg twice a day for 24 hours and at 200mg twice a day thereafter. At that time, her immunosuppression consisted of prednisolone, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. The latter was discontinued due to suspicion of systemic infection. Control bronchoscopy with TBB revealed no histological signs of rejection. In the following days, she developed neurological symptoms: headache, nausea, vertigo and her right side of the mouth was slightly dropped. Also, her left leg was numb, and the muscular strength was decreased. Computerized tomography showed no infiltrates in the lung parenchyma but there were small subcutaneous collections under the sternotomy. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple ring-enhancing lesions with perifocal oedema compatible with abscesses (a and b). Spine MRI showed oedema and multiple abscesses as well in cervical and thoracic spinal cord (c). Subsequently, the histopathological findings from initial skin nodule revealed septal panniculitis with fungal culture and nucleic acid test positive for S. apiospermum. S. apiospermum was also cultured from BAL fluid and the surgical wound secretion. Multiple blood cultures were taken with no signs of fungemia. We refrained from CNS biopsy due to consisted cultural findings matching with radiological appearance.\nNeurological symptoms vanished gradually, and the patient was discharged from the hospital after three weeks of treatment. Intravenous voriconazole was continued at home for ten months. Miltefosine was combined to the therapy one month after initiation of voriconazole but it was discontinued after two days due to nausea, interactions with tacrolimus and on the other hand good clinical response to voriconazole. MRIs and clinical status were controlled every one to four months. After ten months of intravenous administration voriconazole was switched to oral tablets with a dose of 300mg twice daily. Therapeutic serum levels were confirmed by repeated measurements (target therapeutic limits 2–5.5mg/l). At a control visit in June 2018 three years after LT and 35 months of treatment, the voriconazole treatment was terminated. After the discontinuation of antifungal treatment, the patient has visited our clinic for two controls with no signs of fungal re-infection. The last visit was in January 2019, nearly four years after the LT and eight months after the termination of voriconazole. She was symptomless with preserved lung allograft function: Her FEV1 was 2.7 L (77% predicted). Brain MRI revealed only few residual lesions (d), which had been stable and inactive for months.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JuLiA wANg,18,F,B-,Arthritis,17-12-2023,Adam Chapman,"Thomas and Baker Smith,",Medicare,4459.294751,398,Emergency,21-12-2023,Ibuprofen,Inconclusive,"An 18-year-old female was diagnosed with CVID at age six. As previously described in Chen et al. she, her mother, and younger brother were found to have a heterozygous pathogenic variant in NFKB2 that results in an autosomal dominant form of CVID (). She developed autoimmune manifestations, including acquired central adrenal insufficiency, alopecia universalis, vitiligo, and nail dystrophy. Her infectious history was significant for both bacterial and viral respiratory infections, recurrent herpes simplex of the lips and surrounding perioral skin, and chronic candidal onychomycosis. Adrenal insufficiency was treated with maintenance doses of hydrocortisone and stress dose adjustments during times of illness. Early-onset hypogammaglobulinemia required lifelong gammaglobulin replacement to prevent recurrent sinopulmonary infections. Recurrent herpes simplex infection was controlled with chronic suppressive oral valacyclovir therapy. A Luminex-based assay of the patient's plasma [1:100 dilution, as described by Ding et al. ()] identified the presence of autoantibodies against interferon-α (IFN-α) and interferon-ω (IFN-ω) (). Next, patient plasma was incubated with control peripheral blood mononuclear cells and STAT1 phosphorylation was measured by flow cytometry after incubation in unstimulated or stimulated conditions as described by Burbelo et al. (). The patient's plasma demonstrated neutralizing anti-IFN-α and IFN-ω antibodies which inhibited STAT1-phosphorylation in control cells, whereas control and parental plasma did not lead to inhibition (). The affected sibling's plasma also demonstrated neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibodies, and partial blockade of IFN-ω signaling.\nAt 16 years of age, the patient required intensive care hospitalization for decompensated septic shock of unknown etiology requiring vasopressor support. Prior to the hospitalization she had become non-compliant with medications, including gammaglobulin replacement. She developed acute renal injury, electrolyte disturbances, and adrenal crisis secondary to sepsis of unknown etiology which required stress dosing of steroids and electrolyte replacement. During this time, hypomagnesemia resulted in torsades de pointes and prolonged QT syndrome. Her persistent renal injury required chronic daily oral electrolyte replacement to prevent recurrence of arrhythmias.\nTwo years later, the patient presented to the emergency department with a month-long history of progressive, painful, vegetative facial lesions. The lesions initially developed periorally, similar to prior herpes simplex outbreaks. Despite increasing valacyclovir to treatment dosing, the lesions became purulent and continued to spread, involving the nose and right cheek. She was treated for presumed bacterial cellulitis with oral cefdinir. When a bacterial culture reportedly grew group B streptococcus, cefdinir was transitioned to oral clindamycin. Valacyclovir was discontinued as the lesions did not improve while on the medication. She reported tactile fevers and chills with continued progression of the vegetative lesions despite antibiotic treatment.\nUpon hospitalization, laboratory evaluation identified leukocytosis (neutrophils 7,000 cells/μl; lymphocytes 7,900 cells/μl) and elevated C-reactive protein (11.6 mg/dL; normal range 0–1.5 mg/dL). Natural killer (NK) cell expression of CD107a was reduced, and NK cell functional assays demonstrated reduced cytotoxicity (Cincinnati Children's Diagnostic Immunology Laboratory). Her cutaneous exam revealed exophytic, thick, yellow-brown plaques involving the bilateral nares, right oral commissure, and adjacent medial cheek. The plaques were exudative and distorted the nasal architecture (). A wound swab from the medial cheek was positive for HSV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Other bacterial or viral infections often seen in immunodeficient patients, including varicella zoster and cytomegalovirus (CMV), were ruled out. The patient's systemic symptoms raised concern for HSV viremia, and a HSV peripheral blood PCR was positive. She did not have any neurological symptoms or meningeal signs; thus, HSV meningitis or encephalitis were not suspected. HSV type-1 was isolated from tissue culture of affected skin on the medial cheek; pathology demonstrated spongiosis and mixed granulomatous dermal infiltration with fat necrosis. Intravenous foscarnet therapy resulted in rapid improvement of her cutaneous eruption, including the associated pain, and systemic symptoms (). Slower, continued resolution occurred over several weeks (). The patient had recurrence of HSV vegetans and HSV viremia 3 months later. On this second occasion, early identification of HSV as the source of skin infection led to expedited hospitalization and early initiation of antiviral therapy. She had a significantly shorter hospital course with transition to oral valacyclovir at discharge when HSV culture demonstrated susceptibility to acyclovir.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She visited a hospital, and her electrocardiogram showed ST-segment depression in leads I, aVL, and V2–4 (Fig. a). She was suspected of having angina pectoris, and was referred to our hospital. Her laboratory data on admission showed a normal range of creatinine kinase and troponin I as shown in Table . Echocardiography revealed normal left ventricular contraction and mild to moderate aortic regurgitation. Coronary angiography showed severe stenosis in the ostium of both the left main trunk and the right coronary artery (Fig. a, b). Quantitative coronary angiography analysis was performed with a computerized quantitative analysis system (QAngio XA version 7.3, Medis Medical Imaging System, Leiden, The Netherlands), using a contrast-filled catheter as a calibration source. The percentage of the diameter of the most severe stenosis compared with the reference diameter was defined as % diameter stenosis []. % diameter stenosis of the ostial stenosis was 95.0% in the left main trunk and 87.2% in the right coronary artery. Intra-coronary administration of isosorbide dinitrate did not dilate the coronary ostial stenosis, suggesting that the stenosis was an organic lesion. Optimal medical treatment, including beta-blocker, antiplatelet, and statin, was initiated for her coronary artery disease. Contrast-enhanced CT showed no specific abnormality of the aorta (Fig. a, b). She did not have renal artery stenosis or hypertension. Her right and left ankle-brachial indices were 1.08, and 1.03, respectively. She was examined by an ophthalmologist and did not have vision impairment. Magnetic resonance angiography revealed no significant stenosis of her carotid artery. The patient had no coronary risk factors or signs of infectious disease and congenital heart disease. C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (1 h) on admission were 2.13 mg/dL (normal range: 0.00–0.30 mg/dL), 479 μg/mL (normal range: 0.0–8.0 μg/mL), and 40 mm (normal range: 3–15 mm), respectively, suggesting systemic inflammation. 18F-FDG PET/CT showed isolated inflammation of the aortic root (Fig. a, b). She was therefore diagnosed with Takayasu arteritis, and oral administration of prednisolone was started from 0.56 mg/kg/day. Tocilizumab was added 3 months after the initiation of prednisolone (Fig. ). Follow-up coronary angiography showed regression of the ostial stenosis 4 months after the initiation of prednisolone, and % diameter stenosis was 86.7% in the left main trunk and 72.6% in the right coronary artery (Fig. c, d). Intravascular ultrasound or optical coherence tomography was not performed for the ostial lesions. Her C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (1 h) were decreased to 0.03 mg/dL and 5 mm, respectively. The second 18F-FDG PET/CT showed decreased 18F-FDG uptake in the aortic root, but still showed inflammation (Fig. c, d). Her serum amyloid A of 13.8 μg/mL was not normalized, therefore we decided to control the disease activity by combined immunosuppressive treatment including steroid pulse therapy (methylprednisolone 1 g/day for 3 days). Oral methotrexate ranging from 4 to 8 mg/week was administered to decrease corticosteroid dose (Fig. ). The levels of serum amyloid A were not significantly increased and the dose of prednisolone was decreased from 0.28 to 0.21 mg/kg/day after administration of methotrexate.\nMyocardial perfusion imaging with 13N-ammonia PET detected myocardial ischemia (Fig. ). Coronary artery bypass surgery was considered after the suppression of disease activity, but the patient and her family rejected invasive revascularization for coronary artery disease. After immunosuppressive treatment with prednisolone, tocilizumab and methotrexate, chest oppression and ST-segment depression was not observed (Fig. b). She was discharged after a 201-day hospitalization and administered 0.21 mg/kg/day of prednisolone, 8 mg/week of methotrexate, 162 mg/week of tocilizumab, 40 mg/day of isosorbide dinitrate, 15 mg/day of nicorandil, 100 mg/day of aspirin, 2.5 mg/day of rosuvastatin, and 10 mg/day of carvedilol. Electrocardiogram at rest revealed no significant ST-T change, and laboratory data showed no significant increase of C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (1 h), or serum amyloid A in the ambulatory follow-up. She had no cardiac events for 6 months after discharge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She was on synthetic progesterone and tranexamic acid which is an antifibrinolytic agent for menorrhagia. She presented to us with lower abdominal pain, fever, loose stools, and intermittent rectal bleeding. Her blood picture revealed low hemoglobin of 8 gm/dl, increased white cell count of 14000 cells per cubic millimeter, normal platelet count, and normal prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the abdomen showed pelvic collection with an air pocket and thickened sigmoid colon (Figure ). Colonoscopy was performed as she had persistent bleeding per rectum with low hemoglobin and it showed multiple colonic mucosal hemorrhages and a fistulous opening in the sigmoid colon, probably an iatrogenic perforation which happened during prior laparoscopic cyst aspiration. She was planned for computed tomography (CT) guided drainage of the pelvic collection under platelet cover as she was hemodynamically stable and the CT showed only localised collection. Since source control with radiology-guided drainage was inadequate and the patient had persistent fever with loose stools, she was taken up for laparotomy and pelvic abscess drainage. A sigmoid colectomy with proximal end colostomy was also performed as there was a sigmoid perforation which resulted in pelvic abscess and dense adhesions. She received single donor platelets and irradiated packed red blood cells during surgery. In the postoperative period, she had a surgical site hematoma and her hemoglobin dropped to 5.6 gm/dl. Irradiated packed red cells and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched single donor platelets were transfused. Thromboelastography (TEG) was performed pre- and post-platelet transfusion to assess the response as she had previously received platelet transfusions and the risk of alloimmunisation was high. Following transfusion, her hemoglobin was stable and there was no further active bleeding. She had a prolonged hospital stay and delayed postoperative recovery due to protracted ileus, hematoma, and superficial surgical site infection. Her central line and skin staples were removed under platelet cover as per the instructions of the hematology team.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient denied fever, hemoptysis, weight loss, or tobacco use. Past medical history included immune thrombocytopenia for 3 years before the visit, for which she received 1.5 years of oral glucocorticoid. Laboratory examinations revealed iron deficiency anemia (hemoglobin = 90 g/L), platelet count of 6 × 109/L, and total white cell count of 4.4 × 109/L. Urinalysis, liver function, electrolytes, and creatinine were within normal ranges. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate (>140 mm/h), C-reactive protein (150.1 mg/L), and serum IL-6 (7.3 pg/mL), IL-8 (279 pg/mL), tumor necrosis factor-α (175.0 pg/mL) were significantly elevated. Serum measurement of immunoglobulins showed elevated total IgG of 27.59 g/L, while serum IgG4, M protein, serum, and urine immunofixation electrophoresis and light chain were negative or normal. Hypocomplementemia (C4 = 0.079 g/L), positive antinuclear antibodies (titer 1:160), and positive Coombs test were found. Additional clinically relevant autoantibodies, (1–3)-β-D-glucan, galactomannan, interferon gamma release assay, and tumor markers were negative or normal. Pulmonary function tests revealed restriction and decreased diffusing capacity with forced vital capacity of 2.05 L (65.9% predicted), total lung capacity of 2.83 L (68.9% predicted) and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide of 28.8% predicted. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed multiple well-defined nodules randomly distributed in both lung fields and mediastinum lymphadenopathy, with no significant pleural effusion (Fig. ). Bronchoscopy demonstrated no endobronchial pathological lesions, and a culture of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed no evidence of tuberculosis or fungal infection. Cytological evaluation was negative for malignant cells. A CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy was performed, and histopathological examinations revealed some defining features for hyalinizing granuloma, including homogenous hyaline lamellae around small blood vessels and dense infiltrates of lymphocytes, plasma cells with frequent lymph follicle formation (Fig. ). The patient was diagnosed with PHG, and received prednisone 1 mg/kg/d and tacrolimus. Unfortunately, 6 months after initiation of therapy with prednisone gradually tapered, neither pulmonary lesions nor platelet level revealed remarkable interval change. As detailed investigations in clinic failed to uncover any more underlying condition, the patient underwent video-assisted pulmonary wedge biopsy.\nIntraoperatively, multiple white and tough-elastic nodules were found in the upper and lower lobes of lung, partially fused to mass, with pulmonary parenchyma edema surrounded. One isolated lesion was dissected from the left upper lobe, which contained 2 nodules. The diameters of nodules were 1 and 2 cm, and specimens were sent for microorganism culture and pathological examination, respectively. Microorganism culture was negative. Pathologic exam revealed nodular interstitial pink deposits in lungs which stained pink with hematoxylin and eosin, and pathologic examination also showed lymph node hyperplasia and follicular architecture along broncho vascular bundle and under the pleura, with plasma cell infiltration (Fig. a). On immunohistochemical stains, the hyperplastic cells were positive for CD20 (follicle), CD138 and negative for CD3, IgG, and IgG4. Congo-red, alcoholized Congo-red (Fig. b), alkaline Congo-red stains, and kappa and lambda light chain immunostains were positive.

She had been diagnosed with Graves' disease two months earlier with an initial presentation of unintentional weight loss, palpitations, tremors, and diarrhea, but no compressive symptoms. She was prescribed methimazole which she intermittently took. Her family history was significant for a cousin with thyroid cancer, mother with uterine cancer, half-brother with skin cancer, and two relatives with breast cancer.\nIn the emergency room, she had tachycardia (heart rate 155 beats/minute) and orthostatic hypotension. She was afebrile. Her exam was notable for a diffusely enlarged thyroid with no palpable nodules. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, and a chest X-ray was negative.\nShe was admitted due to concern for impending thyroid storm and was started on atenolol and restarted on methimazole. Her symptoms improved gradually after initiation of these medications. During the hospitalization, she had a thyroid ultrasound which showed an enlarged hyperemic thyroid gland consistent with Graves' disease and an indeterminate focal area (1.3 × 1.7 × 1.1 cm) in the right lobe containing abnormal linear echogenicities (). She was discharged home on methimazole with outpatient follow-up. At her follow-up visit two weeks later, the patient had a repeat ultrasound which showed a similar 1.7 cm nodule with indistinct margins containing linear and punctate echogenicities, concerning for microcalcifications. A fine-needle biopsy of the nodule was performed, and it showed a benign cluster of reactive follicular cells and lymphocytes (Bethesda II). Despite the cytology results, there was a continued concern for malignancy given the sonographic features of the nodule in the first two ultrasounds, so repeat imaging was performed four months later, which showed minimal change in the nodule size and features.\nGiven the poorly defined thyroid nodule and the patient's desire for definitive therapy for the hyperthyroidism, she underwent a total thyroidectomy. The surgery was complicated by postoperative hypoparathyroidism for which she received intravenous and oral calcium and oral calcitriol. Surgical pathology identified benign thyroid tissue with papillary hyperplasia and a benign nodule of ITT with foci of Hassall's corpuscles with calcifications (). At follow-up visits, she was started on levothyroxine for postoperative hypothyroidism. Her calcium levels improved such that calcitriol was discontinued and oral calcium dosing was decreased.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She reported no raw meat consumption and had a dog until a year ago. She received vaccination for human papillomavirus 3 years ago. The best corrected visual acuity was 20/22 in both eyes.\nThe anterior segment examination was unremarkable in both eyes. The fundus examination showed bilateral grayish-white retinal lesions around the macula, and the optical coherence tomography showed corresponding hyperreflectivity and thinning of the outer retina (Fig. ). The features of tuberculous serpiginous-like choroiditis such as vitreous hyper-reflective spots, intraretinal edema, sub-retinal pigment epithelium drusenoid deposits, and choroidal granulomas were not present []. The lesion was hypofluorescent and hyperfluorescent in the early and late phases, respectively, on fluorescein fundus angiography (FA). The lesion was hypofluorescent from the early to late phase on indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) (Fig. ).\nThe intraocular pressures were 18 and 15 mmHg in the right and left eyes, respectively.\nNo abnormalities were detected with blood tests except for a mild increase of C-reactive protein (0.4 mg/dL) and white blood cells (10,020/μL). We performed QuantiFERON tests at the initial presentation and 2 weeks later, which showed negative results.\nShe was diagnosed with serpiginous choroiditis and treated with prednisone 40 mg/day.\nOn the 6th day, the retinal lesion was enlarged, and the outer retinal damage had progressed (Fig. b). Thus, transvenous methylprednisolone (mPSL; 1 g/day) was administered for 3 days.\nAfter the initiation of the steroid pulse therapy, the subjective symptoms improved. However, the grayish-white retinal lesions continued to enlarge in both eyes. The disease progression was not controlled despite 3 more days of mPSL (1 g/day), following 60 mg of oral prednisone. Sub-Tenon’s triamcinolone acetonide injection (20 mg) was administered to the left eye and then to the right eye. (Fig. c).\nWe added oral cyclosporine (300 mg), and prednisone was switched to betamethasone (7 mg). The trough blood cyclosporin concentration was monitored and controlled at around 200 ng/mL. While the initially affected areas changed to atrophic scars, new lesions appeared adjacent to or away from the initial lesion (Fig. d). Subcutaneous injections of adalimumab (80 mg) were started on the 27th day, and intravitreal injections of triamcinolone acetonide (20 mg) were administered in the right eye on the 34th day, but they could not stop the disease progression. Oral cyclosporine (300 mg) and betamethasone (3 mg) and biweekly subcutaneous injections of adalimumab (40 mg) were continued, but the retinal lesions progressed up to 8 months (Fig. e). Her visual acuity declined to 20/66 and 20/200 in the right and left eyes, respectively. Both eyes showed a similar course during the observation period.

She presented a hypotrophy of the bicuspid, tricuspid and gastrocnemius muscles and no signs of hemodynamic decompensation. She had negative family history of sudden death, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases. Her electrocardiogram presents a sinus rhythm with alterations of the ventricular repolarization as inverted T wave in V2-V3, poor progression of the r wave in the precordial leads, maybe as a result of kyphosis, and high voltages in the peripheral leads (Figure ). The echocardiogram performed at the time of admission shows asymmetric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, particularly in the mid-apical anterior wall (24 mm), in the absence of signs of left ventricular outflow obstruction, tricuspid aortic valve, and slight pericardial effusion, especially at anterior level, associated with epicardial fibrin deposits. Mitral, pulmonary, and tricuspid deficiency was mild.\nThe young patient was born prematurely at 31 weeks of gestation by cesarean section, and immediately after one hour, she developed respiratory distress and hypoglycemia and was admitted to neonatal intensive care and assisted by intermittent positive pressure ventilation. During the hospitalization, she was subjected to five blood transfusions for anemia, neonatal jaundice phototherapy and antibiotic and antifungal therapies for candida infection. The perinatal encephalic ultrasound allowed to identify small hemorrhage at the level of the caudate nucleus, bilateral peritrigonal hyperechogenicity, and an inhomogeneous area in the right thalamo-striatal region of probable hypoxic-ischemic nature. She was discharged from the neonatal hospital after 68 days with diagnose of prematurity and moderate asphyxiation.\nAt two years old, the child begins to present bilateral sensorineural hearing loss that suddenly gets worse after three years, for which she is performed to right cochlear implant and left retroauricular prosthesis.\nThe many brain MR performed before the implant showed a stationary neuroradiological image of alterations in bilateral periventricular and peritrigonal cerebral white matter by perinatal suffering.\nHer clinical history and her lower limbs spasticity have led doctors to diagnose spastic diplegia and to start physiotherapy and orthosis treatments associated with focal therapy with botulinum toxin to reduce hypertonicity. During the years, physicians have witnessed a progressive worsening of walking, from a double support to the use of walker associated with orthopedic and orthotic shoes, and disturbed by equinovarism of the feet and global internal rotation of the lower limbs. At ten years, Achilles tendon extension surgery was also necessary to improve the gait of the small patient.\nDuring cardiology admission, her laboratory tests were all within normal limits, including the serum CK level (69 U/l, normal range 26-192). The Holter electrocardiogram showed rare single supraventricular extrasystoles and some monomorphic ventricular extrasystoles, with superior axis and right bundle branch block morphology, as arising from the left ventricle. Spirometry found a moderate degree of restrictive ventilatory deficit.\nGiven the complex clinical conditions, a genetic counseling was also recommended for the patient.

She initially presented to a peripheral hospital with left-sided chest pain and worsening shortness of breath, and no constitutional symptoms. She was found to have a large left-sided pleural effusion on CT thorax, presumed to be parapneumonic. She was started on antibiotic therapy including cephalexin and azithromycin. Initial thoracentesis was performed and 700ml of murky blood-tinged fluid drained. A 10.2 French Wayne pigtail catheter was inserted and approximately 2 liters of similar fluid was drained. Despite the chest tube, she had evidence of a persistent large, loculated left-sided pleural effusion and was transferred to our Tertiary Care Centre for further management. At presentation to our centre, she was found to have elevated white blood cell count of 15.4 x 109/L and platelet count of 634 x 109/L. A bedside chest tube insertion was undertaken, with subsequent CT thorax demonstrating no change in the size of the large left complex collection (). Therefore, the presence of an underlying abscess with a possible underlying necrotic mass was considered, and interventional radiology was consulted with the view to biopsy or drain depending on context characteristics. The fluid collection appeared extra pleural to the IR upon review of the CT. The thoracic radiologist agreed. Ultrasound revealed a multiseptated rounded extra parenchymal thoracic collection. A chest tube was inserted under ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance, with 500 ml of serosanguineous fluid drained. Cytology did not reveal malignancy. The patient was discharged on Levofloxacin. Follow-up CT in one month demonstrated accumulation of the fluid, not expected in the case of a presumed empyema after adequate drainage. The patient underwent video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS), which was converted to open thoracotomy upon discovery of a cystic structure extending into the mediastinum. The mass was partially resected and talc pleurodesis was performed. Histopathology revealed the diagnosis of mediastinal lymphangioma, demonstrating an irregular multiloculated cyst wall composed of channels and papillae and lined by bland flat cells.

Clinical examination in the left eye showed that the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/40 (Snellen chart). Ultrasound imaging revealed the presence of a cyst in the vitreous cavity on the left eye. Fundus examination showed a free-floating and semi-translucent vitreous cyst in the mid-vitreous cavity and retinal vasculitis with optic disc edema. The patient underwent a 23-gauge pars plana vitrectomy (Constellation System, Alcon). The cyst was extracted in whole (Fig. a) with laser photocoagulation. The flat mount of the cyst was identified as oval cysticercus with a length of 0.5 cm, containing invaginated a scolex with hooklets (Fig. b).\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with Gd-DTPA as the contrast agent was performed. MRI of the orbits and brain showed well-defined ring-enhancing cystic lesions with eccentric scolexes in the extraocular muscles, brain parenchyma (Fig. a), tongue, face, neck muscles, and cutaneous tissues (Fig. b). Abdominal MRI revealed round hyperintense lesions in the diaphragm, abdominal muscles, erector spinae, and psoas magnus muscles in T2-weighted images (T2WI) with an identifiable hypointense nidus in T1-weighted images (T1WI) and T2WI.

She had associated inconsistent left flank pain, fatigue, palpitations, and increased urinary frequency, at least twice during the day and four times during the night. Although the patient had these complaints for 12-15 months, they only came into notice on a routine checkup nine months ago. There was no history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and no family history of kidney diseases. The patients' ambulatory blood pressure readings revealed continuously elevated blood pressure as high as 200/110 mm Hg.\nOn examination, her heart rate was 96 bpm, blood pressure was 170/110 mm Hg, and she was afebrile. Abdominal examination was unremarkable except for mild left lumbar tenderness on palpation. There were no other findings.\nAn extensive workup was done and the secondary causes of hypertension, such as pheochromocytoma, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, renin-secreting tumor, Cushing’s disease, and hyperthyroidism, were ruled out. Urine routine examination revealed albumin 1+, blood 4+, and red blood cells (RBCs) >100/HPF. Doppler ultrasonography (USG) of the kidneys revealed left-sided renal artery stenosis, with the left kidney smaller in size (8 x 3.5 x.1.2 cm) as compared to the right kidney (11 x 3.0 x 1.3 cm). Magnetic renal angiogram (MRA) was performed to correlate the previous findings. It showed a small left kidney (7 x 3 cm) with cortical scarring and diffuse narrowing of the left main renal artery with a small portion of focal stenosis at the level of approximately 9 mm from the ostium.\nThe workup suggested left renal artery stenosis. The patient was admitted to undergo renal angiography and stenting if needed. The renal angiography showed a normal right renal angiogram without any areas of focal stenosis or narrowing and the right renal veins were draining normally. The left renal angiogram showed cortical scarring and a normal left renal artery without any areas of focal stenosis (Figure ). Delayed left renal vein emptying was seen (Figure ).

The patient’s most recent menstrual period had occurred 6 months prior. On admission, the patient was in a generally good condition, without any other remarkable symptoms, and with BMI 18.5 kg/m2 (174 cm tall and 56 kg weight), and Tanner stage V (breast and pubic hair). Menarche occurred at 13y. Previously to the amenorrhea, the patient had reported irregular menstrual cycles. Upon physical examination, acne and abnormal eyelid development with ptosis and microphthalmia (a corneal diameter of less than 10 mm and an antero-posterior diameter of the globe of less than 20 mm), were observed. Her past medical history was remarkable for several ophthalmic defects that had required surgical interventions. At 1 year old, the patient had received frontalis suspension surgery using an autogenous graft (fascia lata) to treat blepharoptosis and poor levator muscle function. A year later, this was followed by lateral canthopexy. Finally, in 2015, II:3 underwent canthoplasty to correct the epicanthus inversus, and telecanthus; however, BPES syndrome was not suspected at that time, despite the patient reporting a similar phenotype (concerning ophthalmic alternations, Fig. ) occurring in her father (I:1, Fig. ), sister (II:1) and half-sister (II:4).\nHormonal diagnosis was performed. The progesterone withdrawal test was positive. Serum hormone levels were measured on the 3rd day of the menstrual cycle. Due to low estradiol levels, hormonal replacement therapy was introduced (estradiol 2 mg daily between the 5th and 26th days of the menstrual cycle, and dydrogesterone 10 mg daily between the 15th and 26th days). Blood samples and laboratory tests were performed every 3 months. The results of the blood tests are presented in Table . Initially, elevated levels of FSH (21.9 [IU/L]), normal LH and decreased levels of estradiol (5.3 [pg/ml]) were detected. During the follow-up period these levels tended to normalize; however Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) concentrations decreased to below the critical threshold (0.52 ng/ml). These data are presented in Table .\nAdrenal hormones were also measured during endocrine investigation. Elevated 17-OHP levels were observed. To exclude primary the authors performed conventional-dose short test with 250 μg of synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone (Synacthen test) (Table ). This test revealed appropriate adrenal function and the patient was scheduled for a follow-up observation.\nThe patient’s pelvic ultrasound results remained unremarkable (normal uterus and ovaries). The antral follicle count (AFC) was in the normal range, with 5 follicles in the right ovary and 9 in the left.\nThe other three family members (I:1, II:1 and II:4) with suspected BPES were also examined. In all of them signs of blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus were identified. No remarkable medical history was obtained. II:1 (34y) at the age of 14 underwent menarche and up to that age had had regular menses; while II:4 (14y) had not yet reached menarche.

She was taken to the nearest hospital then, for left arm pain, where anteroposterior (AP) and lateral plain X-rays of left humerus showed a minimally displaced transverse fracture at the distal third shaft of the humerus (Figure ). The patient was managed conservatively with a Plaster of Paris (POP) back slab that was replaced by a POP full cast. However, X-ray performed after a period of six weeks showed no callus formation indicating delayed union along with the disappearance of the bone. (Figure ). Serial X-rays taken thereafter showed the persistence of fracture and bone resorption at the site along with generalized osteopenia in the shaft (Figure ). Hence, she was diagnosed with osteomyelitis and treated accordingly. Following no significant improvement of her symptoms and increased bone resorption at the fracture site as seen on X-rays, she was referred to our setup and was admitted for a detailed workup. A thorough evaluation was undertaken at our institution. A careful examination of the patient's left upper limb revealed global decreased muscle strength and limited motion of the left forearm. All active movements in the affected limb were mildly painful and limited at the shoulder and elbow joint, most notably flexion and extension. Wrist movements including gripping were normal. No neurologic deficits were found. A gap of nearly 3 cm was palpable in the distal part of the arm with palpable non-tender bony ends. Soft tissue swelling was absent and no lump was palpable along the length of the humerus. The skin overlying the fracture was normal. X-ray of the left arm was repeated, which showed marked disappearance of bone at fracture site resulting in a gap of 2-3 cm with tapering of bone ends and generalized osteopenia (Figure ).\nThere were no enlarged lymph nodes or any other abnormalities on the rest of her body. A complete blood workup ruled out hyperparathyroidism, renal osteodystrophy, osteomyelitis, vasculitis, etc. as secondary causes of bone resorption. Bone scintigraphy performed next with technetium 99m-methyl diphosphonate (99mTc MDP), showed mildly increased tracer uptake at distal 2/3rd of the shaft, ruling out our suspicion of malignancy. MRI scans revealed cortical and medullary erosion at left humeral shaft and complete resorption of the distal shaft with tapering of bone, indicating GSS. Consecutively, an incisional bone biopsy was sent for histopathologic evaluation, which demonstrated the increased proliferation of thin-walled vessels with no evidence of inflammatory or neoplastic cells, confirming GSS of the left humerus. The non-healing nature of the fracture, laboratory and radiological findings and histopathology exam fulfilled the criteria for Gorham disease suggested by Heffez et al. (Table ).\nConsistent with the present literature on suitable treatment of upper extremity GSS, we planned to undertake a reconstructive surgery of left humerus using a fibular graft.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She never took any medication for systemic disease and never had the same vaginal bleeding before pregnancy. She wasn't a smoker and no one in her family had the same complaint. She didn't take any birth-controlling pills or injection. The first vaginal bleeding happened a week after cesarean section without any abnormality being found. Recurrent bleeding happened and PRC transfusion was administered due to severe anemic condition with the lowest hemoglobin being 4 gr/dl a week later. Another episode of vaginal bleeding resulted in lowering hemoglobin to 7.72 g/dl and caused an emergency referral to our center. From transvaginal ultrasound examination, at the left area of cesarean scar, hematoma was seen in a non-homogenous area. It was connected to the left uterine artery branch, then diagnosed as AVMs and planned for TAE (Figure 3A). Sheath 5F on left common femoral artery was introduced. The end of catheter was placed on distal left internal iliac artery. Saccular dilatation of left uterine artery was found with sign of extravasation of the artery, and also hypervascularization and hypertrophy of left uterine artery (Figure 3B).

The patient admitted that she was attempting to commit suicide. On presentation, the patient's only complaint was sleepiness. 14-point review of systems was otherwise negative.\nOn physical examination, initial vital signs were within normal limits. Triage vital signs were as follows: temperature 36.8 C, blood pressure 113/59 mm Hg, heart rate 72 beats/min, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, and SpO2 98% on room air. The patient's initial mental status evaluation was remarkable for somnolence; however, she was arousable to voice and otherwise grossly intact neurologically. No other remarkable physical exam findings were found.\nOn laboratory evaluation, initial CMP and CBC were within normal limits. Salicylate and acetaminophen levels were undetectable. Ethanol level was unremarkable at 11 mg/dL. Initial EKG was remarkable for QTC prolongation and patient was subsequently treated with 2 grams of intravenous magnesium. The patient was also started on intravenous fluid hydration at 200 mL/hr of normal saline. Magnesium level was within normal limits. Her urine drug screen was negative.\nOn reevaluation approximately 4 hours after initial presentation due to a nurse appropriately contacting a physician, the patient was found to be persistently hypotensive with consistent blood pressure recordings hovering around 80/30 mm Hg (). The patient's heart rate was in the 70s during this time period. She was administered 2 liters of fluid resuscitation.

The pregnancy followed spontaneous conception in a non-consanguineous marriage of six months and was confirmed by a urine pregnancy test at home.\nShe developed acute, severe, lower abdominal pain, stabbing in nature and associated with shoulder tip pain. There was no history of dysmenorrhea prior to pregnancy. Past medical and surgical history was insignificant. She was an unbooked case, hence no records of routine pregnancy scans or investigations were available.\nOn arrival, the patient was conscious, well-oriented, and afebrile. General examination revealed severe pallor and hypovolemic shock. Blood pressure was 50/30 mmHg and pulse rate was 120 beats per minute. The abdomen was found to be tense, tender, and mildly distended. Pelvic examination demonstrated a healthy vagina. The cervical os was closed with no evidence of bleeding. The size of the uterus could not be determined due to intense guarding. Cervical excitation was found to be positive. Tenderness and fullness were present in both fornices.\nHer investigations showed hemoglobin of 7.6 g/dl and raised total leukocyte count of 22.5 x103 while serum electrolytes, urea, creatinine, and coagulation profiles were normal. She was immediately managed with two intravenous cannulas for fluid resuscitation and was catheterized. Blood was sent for cross match and four units of blood were arranged. A provisional diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy was made and she was transferred to the operation theatre for emergency exploratory laparotomy.\nThe abdomen was opened by a Pfannenstiel incision and a hemoperitoneum of 1.5 liters was encountered along with an extrauterine 17-week fetus floating in the peritoneal cavity. Further exploration revealed a right-sided ruptured non-communicating rudimentary horn (5 cm x 4 cm) attached to the uterine cavity with a 2.5 cm fibrous band (Figure ). Both the ovaries and left Fallopian tube were found to be healthy. The rudimentary horn was excised and a right salpingectomy was performed and hemostasis was secured. The patient received two packs of blood intraoperatively. The resected uterine segment was repaired (Figure ) followed by closure of the abdomen.\nIntravenous urography was performed which revealed no urological abnormalities.

AngelA REYnOlDs,18,F,A+,Diabetes,16-10-2019,Andrea Calderon,Rich Ltd,Cigna,39421.80191,315,Urgent,18-10-2019,Lipitor,Inconclusive,"An 18-year-old female long-distance runner who belonged to her university’s road running club presented to our institution with a half-year history of persistent left hindfoot pain when running. She was of Japanese ethnicity and her height and weight were 162 cm and 45.1 kg, respectively. Her body mass index was 17.2. She had no history of previous trauma. However, she had a medical history of amenorrhea and iron deficiency anemia, which responded to iron supplementation. Her weekly training regimen consisted of cross-country jogging for 120 km, track jogging for 200 min, and speed exercise for 200 min.\nPhysical examination revealed hindfoot valgus of both feet and swelling on the hindfoot region and tenderness in the area slightly lateral to the lateral border of the Achilles tendon at the level of the distal malleolus. When the left ankle joint was forced into plantarflexion, she complained of pain in the left hindfoot region. However, ankle and hindfoot motion were within the full range. Plain radiographs of the left ankle showed no abnormality. Non-contrast computed tomography (CT) revealed a fracture line in the lateral tubercle of the posterior talar process. The fracture line was located just lateral to the groove for the flexor hallucis longus (FHL) tendon in the axial plane and positioned just proximal to the subtalar joint in the sagittal plane (Fig. ). Dual-energy X-ray absorption revealed that the Z-score was less than − 1.0, which was diagnosed as low bone density based on the diagnostic criteria of the American College of Sports Medicine []. Based on the physical examination, medical history, and radiological findings, the diagnosis was stress fracture in the lateral tubercle of the posterior talar process. Immediately after diagnosis, conservative therapy, including non-weightbearing using a patellar tendon-bearing brace and low-intensity pulsed ultrasound, was started to facilitate consolidation of the fracture. However, the fracture did not show any signs of healing 3 months after instituting conservative therapy, so we opted for surgical intervention via two-portal access hindfoot endoscopy.\nThe operation was performed using a pneumatic tourniquet (280 mmHg) and general anesthesia with the patient in the prone position. Based on the procedure reported by van Dijk et al., posterolateral and posteromedial portals were created at the level of the tip of the lateral malleolus, just medial and lateral to the Achilles tendon []. A 4.0-mm arthroscope with a 30° angle was introduced through the posterolateral portal, while a 4.0-mm motorized shaver was introduced through the posteromedial portal. Adipose tissue was dissected with the motorized shaver exposing the subtalar joint and the FHL tendon, which were landmarks for the insertion point of the screw (Fig. ). These landmarks were exposed under endoscopy, and a guidewire was then inserted through a sleeve approximately 5 mm lateral to the FHL tendon at a level just above the subtalar joint (Fig. ) through the posteromedial portal. This seemed to be an adequate position to penetrate the fracture line according to preoperative radiological evaluation. Through the guidewire, a cannulated 3-mm double-threaded screw was inserted to fix the fracture in the lateral tubercle of the posterior talar process (Fig. ). After irrigation of the hindfoot space, each portal was sutured.\nPostoperatively, a short leg cast was applied for 4 weeks, and then walking using a patellar tendon-bearing brace was started. Active range of motion exercises were allowed 4 weeks postoperatively, and non-weightbearing was continued until 10 weeks postoperatively. Non-contrast CT at 10 weeks postoperatively revealed consolidation of the stress fracture (Fig. ), so the brace was removed and full weightbearing was started. At 15 weeks postoperatively, the patient was permitted to jog and return to athletic activity while wearing an orthosis. At that time, her running form was examined and she was found to have overpronation at heel strike when running without the orthosis. Her running coach and trainer worked with her to improve her running form, core strength, and static and dynamic alignment. She had no relevant symptoms 5 months postoperatively. As of this writing 2 years postoperative, she remains an active competitive runner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She also reported undocumented weight loss along with headache, dizziness and generalized weakness during this period. On examination at the time of presentation, her vitals were stable. There was mild epigastric tenderness on an abdominal examination. On CNS examination, higher mental functions were intact. Speech and gait were normal. Cranial nerves and sensory system were grossly intact. Signs of cerebellar disease and meningeal irritation were absent. Motor examination revealed a generalized decrease in tone and power of both upper and lower limbs with normal reflexes (++) and down-going plantar response. Examinations of all other systems were otherwise unremarkable.\nLaboratory investigations revealed hemoglobin of 12.3 g/dL, white cell count of 11.4 x 109 IU/L with 81% neutrophils, 12% lymphocytes and 2% monocytes. Platelet count was 476,000 IU/L. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were within the normal range. Serum electrolyte tests, however, showed low potassium levels of 1.8 mEq/L and low bicarbonate levels of 15 mEq/L. Results of liver function tests, clotting profile and urine detailed report were within the normal range. Urinary pH was, however, raised on three consecutive days (pH of 7, 7 and 8 on day 1, day 2 and day 3 respectively). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were within the normal range. Serum amylase and lipase levels were within the normal limit as well. Stool test for Helicobacter pylori antigen was negative. Tests for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-Hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) were also negative. Serum cortisol levels were slightly decreased (8.23 microgram/dL).\nFindings of electrocardiography (ECG), chest x-ray, ultrasound abdomen and computed tomography (CT) scan abdomen with contrast were unremarkable. Results of endoscopy also turned out to be unremarkable. Repeat potassium and bicarbonate levels showed persistently low levels. Considering the possibility of distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA), an autoimmune profile was performed. It revealed positive anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), negative anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), negative anti-ribonucleoprotein (anti-RNP), negative anti-smith antibody (anti-Sm), negative anti-Sjögren's syndrome type A antibody (anti-SS-A), negative anti-Sjögren's syndrome type B antibody (anti-SS-B), negative anti-ScL-70 antibody (autoantibodies against topoisomerase I) and negative anti-Jo-1 antibody (autoantibodies against histidyl-tRNA synthetase). Her complement levels showed slightly low C3 levels of 0.86g/L, while C4 levels were within the normal range.\nThe patient was given sodium bicarbonate tablets and her response to the treatment was observed. She responded well, as indicated by her repeat potassium levels of 3.5 mEq/L, 4.0 mEq/L and 4.2 mEq/L on three different occasions. She was discharged home with advice to follow up.\nFive days after her discharge, she presented in the outpatient clinic with complaints of intractable vomiting, double vision (on looking towards the left side by confrontation method) and inability to stand and walk. The relative afferent pupillary defect was absent. Bilateral fundi were unremarkable. On cranial nerve examination, the patient was unable to adduct her right eye. Other extraocular muscles were intact on the right side. All other movements of extraocular muscles were intact. Motor examination revealed increased tone and reflexes bilaterally in upper and lower limbs. Power was reduced bilaterally in upper and lower limbs (3/5). An up-going plantar response was detected. The sensory system was grossly intact. Signs of cerebellar disease and meningeal irritation were absent.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine was performed. As shown in figure , it revealed abnormal signal intensity changes in the midbrain and pons extending into the periaqueductal region and also inferiorly into the cranial aspect of the cervical spinal cord up to the C5 segment. These were hyperintense on T2 weighted images and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, and iso-intense on T1 weighted images. No evidence of an intracranial bleed, mass or gross area of infarction was found. Findings were suggestive of demyelination or a neurodegenerative disorder.\nTo investigate for transverse myelitis, MRI of dorso-lumbar spine was performed, which was normal. The visual evoked potential was normal in both eyes. A test for anti-NMO antibodies was then performed, which turned out to be positive. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD).\nThe patient was treated with 1 gm high dose intravenous corticosteroids for five days, which resulted in resolution of vomiting and ocular symptoms. After achieving remission, the treatment was slowly transitioned to oral corticosteroids in a dose of 1mg/kg/day. Azathioprine was added in a dose of 3mg/kg/day.

She was born at full term after an uneventful pregnancy. At birth, her weight was 3.062 kg (35th centile), her length was 48.3 cm (32nd centile), and her head circumference was not available. Her early motor development was normal. She had delayed speech with first words at 18 months, followed by additional developmental delays and eventual development of cognitive impairment. At 3 years, she was diagnosed with PDD-NOS, due to loss of social and behavioral skills starting around 2 years of age, sensitivity to loud sounds, impaired coordination, and difficulties with balance.\nShe had a history of behavioral aggression throughout her schooling, particularly with regard to ownership and sharing, which intensified between 16 and 17 years of age, associated with diagnoses of obsessive-compulsive disorder and anxiety. She had one acute out-of-character behavioral episode, characterized by disinhibited behavior and unusual delusions, without hallucinations, lasting a few days at age 17, for which brain MRI, 24-h continuous EEG, and subsequent neurological evaluation were negative. She has never had any observed seizures.\nIn an assessment at 18 years, she was noted to need substantial help with self-care activities and could not understand or follow instructions. Her interactions and behaviors were immature, characterized as a 4-year-old level by her school evaluations. She had short stature and obesity (weight 88.2 kg, > 98th centile; height 153.0 cm, 6th centile; BMI 37.7 kg/m2, 98th centile) with macrocephaly (head circumference 58 cm; > 98th centile) (Table ). She had a history of continuously gorging or binge eating to the point of vomiting, requiring her parents to restrict her food intake.\nShe was mildly dysmorphic, with sparse lateral eyebrows, telecanthus, left preauricular pit, prominent cupid bow configuration of the upper lip, and slack facial expression. She had numerous self-inflicted, skin-picking lesions on her arms, in various stages of healing, and one hyperplastic keloidal scar elsewhere. Her speech was fluent but very simple, with sound substitution errors very typical of a young child. There was periodic echolalia, in addition to outbursts of out-of-context speech, without regard to interrupting other speakers. Negative genetic testing included Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome methylation and MLPA, fragile X, and CNV analysis via SNP microarray. However, areas of homozygosity were identified across multiple chromosomes, with an overall percentage of autosomal/genomic homozygosity of 2.5%. No candidate recessive genes were identified within the homozygous regions. As no specific disease could be suspected on the basis of the clinical presentation, family trio sequencing of GeneDx’s Autism/ID Xpanded Panel with 2308 genes was performed, using oral rinse samples from her and both parents.

Ultrasound detected the presence of an endometrial polyp, which was confirmed on hysteroscopy and removed using a resectoscope. The polyp was approximately 2 cm in length. Histological analysis revealed benign endometrial glands with moderately cellular stromatolites showing some degree of periglandular condensation and mild pleomorphism. No SO or MI was noted. The histological diagnosis of low-grade adenosarcoma was made. Subsequently, the patient was advised to undergo hysterectomy, BSO and lymphadenectomy, but she declined to preserve her fertility. She was referred for a second opinion and following extensive counselling, opted for conservative management.\nOver the following 10 years, she was monitored with pelvic ultrasound, hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy every 6 months, and with annual pelvic magnetic resonance imaging. Follow-up was largely uneventful, with normal imaging and histology. Nine years post-operatively an abnormal appearing area on the posterior aspect of the lower uterine segment was identified on hysteroscopy and subsequently resected. Histology was benign with no features of recurrence.\nEleven years post-operatively, she underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF) and successfully conceived following the first cycle. Unfortunately, she suffered a second trimester miscarriage at 16 weeks’ gestation, with a history suggestive of cervical incompetence after admission with a dilated cervix and bulging membranes. The following year she conceived twins following another IVF cycle. She underwent an uncomplicated elective trans-vaginal cervical suture. She delivered male twins at 28 weeks’ gestation following pre-term labour, which was attributed to placental abruption. Both children are alive and well. She was offered hysterectomy after delivery, and at each subsequent follow-up appointment, but declined as she was uncertain as to whether or not her family was complete. Following pregnancy, her follow-up intensity was reduced to annually with continued ultrasound scans along with hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy. She continued to defer definitive treatment until, after a total of 20 years of follow-up, she finally underwent an uncomplicated laparoscopic hysterectomy with ovarian conservation.

Bilateral symmetric hypertrophic hands, arms and upper part of her trunk were noted already during the neonatal period. During childhood, she was very strong in her arms and hands and could climb using only her upper limbs (Figure E). She was referred for hand surgery because the muscular hypertrophy caused functional limitations with difficulties to grip small objects and problems with the pinch grip. Wide hands and abducted thumbs with difficulty to perform the thumb opposition movement were observed. Rotations osteotomy of the first metacarpal and repeated botulinum toxin injections in the hands' intrinsic muscles were performed to improve the pinch grip. The growth was proportional and no progression of the muscular hypertrophy was noted. The difficulty to move the wrists, fingers rotations and elbows deformity led to several surgical procedures.

When she was 11 years old, she had been treated with oral colchicine as an initial treatment, but her symptoms continued with repeated aggravation and remission. Biologic agents such as etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, and tocilizumab, in combination with methotrexate, were sequentially administered. However, these combination therapies did not result in significant improvement.\nPhysical examination revealed aphthae and mild tenderness in the lower right abdomen. Laboratory test results (Table ) showed elevated levels of C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A. No elevation of monoclonal or polyclonal γ-globulin was found. The patient's human leukocyte antigen A26 was positive, but B51 was negative. Owing to a relatively low level of white blood cells despite a strong, persistent inflammatory condition, she was suspected of having some kind of immunodeficiency disease. To investigate any possible genetic abnormalities, chromosomal examination of peripheral blood was performed. The results indicated a karyotype of trisomy 8 in 87% of cells. Bone marrow examination showed dysplastic cells in multilineages, without atypical cells in peripheral blood. These findings were consistent with MDS/refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia. The patient was thus referred to our department for further treatment, including HSCT. Colonoscopy revealed huge ulceration in the cecum and small erosions in the terminal ileum (Fig. A). Intravenous methylprednisolone was administered for the treatment of active intestinal BD and the oral prednisolone (PSL) dose was increased. Nevertheless, this did not alleviate her symptoms, especially intense abdominal pain. Thus, the patient subsequently underwent selective ileocecal resection and ileostomy because abdominal enhanced computed tomography showed thickening of the ileocecal wall with ascites around the cecum. The pathological findings in the resected specimen revealed that the cecum ulceration featured microperforation into the retroperitoneal space, forming small abscesses. The infiltrating cells were mainly neutrophils, and no abnormal cells were found. Colonoscopy after surgery showed no recurrence of intestinal ulcers (Fig. B). Six months after the surgical operation, the patient was admitted to the Department of Hematology in our hospital to receive allogeneic PBSCT with her mother as a donor. The transplantation was successful with no adverse events, resulting in the complete disappearance of trisomy 8 (Fig. ). Seven months after the PBSCT, the symptoms of BD (fever, oral aphthae, abdominal pain, and genital ulcers) had disappeared and were kept in remission with oral PSL (10 mg/day).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient denied any occurrence of nausea, vomiting, or pain. Transvaginal ultrasound revealed a large cystic mass spanning the abdominal and pelvic regions. The only notable laboratory finding was a mild elevation in tumor marker CA 19-9. Subsequent CT imaging exhibited an enlarged, wandering spleen measuring 24.5 × 16.0 × 12.0 cm, in the patient's left lower abdomen and extending into the anterior mid pelvis (). No evidence of venous or arterial obstruction was noted. A 16.0 × 15.7 × 1.4 cm mass in the inferior aspect of the spleen was seen composed of a large central cystic space with several peripheral cystic structures of varying sizes. Minimal calcification was demonstrated along the septations within the lesion. In addition, an 1.7 × 1.5 × 1.6 cmsolid-appearing region was detected at the left mid anterior aspect of the spleen, possibly representing a portion of the vascular pedicle. The patient presented no other notable medical history or physical findings. An open splenectomy was deemed appropriate for treatment in order to prevent torsion of the splenic pedicle.\nExtirpation of the spleen revealed a circumscribed 16 cm gray-white, smooth, and fibrotic mass. Serial sectioning of the mass showed a large cyst filled with yellow fluid. The lining was smooth, tan and focally hemorrhagic. Many smaller peripheral cystic lesions of variable sizes emanated from this larger cystic space, measuring between 0.4 and 0.3 cm. No echinococcal cysts or papillary excrescences were detected. Microcalcifications were noted in many sites of the cyst wall septations. Histology showed a variable stratified squamous cell epithelium and simple cuboidal to flat mesothelial cell lining on densely fibrotic walls of variably sized cystic spaces. () Immunohistochemistry was positive for CK5/6 and CEA in the squamous lining of the cystic spaces, confirming a splenic epidermoid cyst. (Figures –) The mesothelial cells were also CK5/6 but were also calretinin positive. Mucicarmine focally marked mucous cells within the squamous epithelial lining. () No skin adnexa or other mesodermal or endodermal structures were seen, helping to exclude a dermoid cyst or cystic teratoma. Echinococcus IgG study was negative, helping to exclude a hydatid cyst. Rare areas of stratified squamous epithelium had focal mucous-type cells, positive on mucicarmine-stained tissue sections, a feature also described in epidermoid cysts []. The pedicle of the wandering spleen had lymphatic, arterial and venous vessels of variable sizes and somewhat disordered distribution, mimicking a vascular malformation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She had medical history of mitral valve prolapse without mitral regurgitation. She presented with sudden onset of left leg weakness before fever. Intermittent low-grade fever, malaise, and poor appetite were noted after the leg weakness. She went to a clinic in her hometown, Indonesia, which diagnosed her with urinary tract infection and administered oral antibiotics. The fever subsided after the initiation of antibiotics. However, low-grade fever recurred after completing the antibiotics treatment. Left abdominal dull pain occurred. She was referred to Malaysia for further management. On examination, left leg weakness with muscle power of 3 was noted. Janeway lesions were found on her left palm and fingers. An apical pansystolic murmur was heard. The white blood cell count was 17.56 × 109/L (normal, 4.0–11.3 × 109/L) with 84% neutrophils (normal, 47%–80%); hemoglobin, 10.1 g/dL (normal, 12.5–16.0 g/dL); platelet count, 467 × 109/L (normal, 140–450 × 109/L); and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 98 mml/hour (normal, 0–20 mml/hour). Three sets of blood culture revealed S anginosus, which was sensitive to all cephalosporin antibiotics. Transthoracic echocardiogram identified mitral valve prolapse with moderate eccentric mitral valve regurgitation with a 0.3 × 0.6-cm vegetation found on the left mitral valve. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed disseminated septic emboli with microabscess in bioccipital and right posterior parietal juxtacortical region (Fig. ). Abdominal computed tomography scan revealed splenic and left kidney infarction (Fig. ).

It started as a small nodule that progressively increased in size over time, and another small mass developed beside it two weeks before the diagnosis. The patient started to develop fever, rigor, and chills. She underwent incision and drainage, and antibiotics were prescribed for her in a primary health care center, which delayed the diagnosis for two more months. On examination, there was a 6×6 cm rounded, firm mass with a mass of approximately 1.5 cm extending from it. The large mass had an open wound with foul-smelling, purulent discharge leaking from the wound with no other masses on the same side. There were no palpable left inguinal or other lymph nodes upon physical examination. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left foot showed a large exophytic, lobulated, and enhancing mass, measuring 6 × 4.5 × 6 cm with central necrosis in the soft tissue of the midfoot. The lesion also involved the flexor hallucis and abductor hallucis muscles (). Six core punch biopsies were taken from the large and small masses and confirmed a diagnosis of CCS. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis was also performed, which revealed multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the left inguinal region and on the left side of the abdominal aortic bifurcation. Lung and abdominal CT were performed and showed no signs of distant metastasis. The patient underwent a left below-the-knee amputation as a palliative procedure. Pathological examination of the amputated specimen showed a grossly fungating mass with focal surface ulceration in the medial side of the foot. The mass was partially necrotic and grossly infiltrated the tendons but did not reach the underlying bone.\nOn microscopic examination of the lesion, a biopsy showed deep dermal infiltration of loosely cohesive, round to oval malignant cells exhibiting eccentric nuclei with a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, abundant clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm, and abnormal mitosis (mitotic count, 25/10 HPF) (Figures and ).\nA panel of immunohistochemical markers was used for testing.

The patient described a dull, throbbing sensation that occurred intermittently, lasting from 30 minutes to 60 minutes, first starting one month prior and worsening over that time. The pain was localized to the dorsum of the foot, ankle, and anterior shin. It was associated with an intermittent bluish discoloration of the extremity; however, this was not present at the time of presentation. The patient shared a photo of the discoloration she had noted previously (Figure ).\nThe patient had been seen three times for this pain in the past month. The first presentation was at an urgent care center, where she was discharged with ibuprofen and follow-up with a primary care physician in the area, with instructions to present to an ED if symptoms worsened. When symptoms worsened, the patient presented to a pediatric ED, where she underwent an X-ray of her left foot and ankle with no abnormalities, and provided orthopedic specialty follow-up. At the orthopedic clinic, the patient was provided with exercise instructions for ankle sprains, with instructions that further testing might be required if the pain did not improve. The patient presented to the ED after episodes of pain, discoloration, and change in temperature became more frequent and began to limit her ability to exercise in school, and the patient started to require intermittent use of crutches.\nOn examination, the patient’s left lower extremity was atraumatic, of normal color, and without pain to palpation over bony prominences or when the ankle joint was manipulated. Pulses were palpable over the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis arteries. No swelling was noted. The patient’s left lower extremity appeared colder to the touch than the right lower extremity, and the patient had pain when asked to walk without crutches and did so with an antalgic gait. Reflexes, strength, and sensation were all intact in both lower extremities. The remainder of the patient’s physical exam revealed no abnormalities, including neurologic, cardiovascular, abdominal, and respiratory exams. A complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and urinalysis were within normal limits, and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) was negative.\nAfter the exam and laboratory work were found unremarkable, the patient was sent for lower extremity venous and arterial doppler. There was no evidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the left lower extremity common femoral, femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, or proximal greater saphenous veins. Arterial doppler revealed, “no plaque is noted neither is thrombus. Flow appears to be within normal limits. However, velocities may be somewhat decreased below the knee on the left side”. This study, although within normal limits, prompted computed tomography angiography (CTA) of bilateral lower extremity for further evaluation and correlation. CTA revealed “mild stenosis of the left common iliac vein, secondary to compression from the overlying right common iliac artery. This finding may be seen in the clinical setting of May-Thurner syndrome; however, there were no obvious iliac venous DVT and no pelvic venous collaterals.” This finding is shown below (Figure ).\nVascular surgery was called and notified about the case from the emergency department. The patient was admitted to the internal medicine service with a vascular surgery consult from the emergency department in stable condition, with intact pulses in bilateral lower extremities. The patient received an MRI of the lumbar spine without contrast the next day to further evaluate the area of concern and to rule out other causes for the patient’s symptoms. This study again revealed flattening of the left iliac vein by the right iliac artery. This finding is shown below (Figure ):\nThe patient was taken for angioplasty of the left common iliac vein the next day, and an 80% stenosis of the vein was discovered during the procedure by venogram. After angioplasty, repeat venogram intraoperatively showed minimal recoiling of 50%. The patient tolerated the procedure well and noted the next morning, no pain or cyanosis in her left lower extremity while standing in the shower, which was a very common time for her to have the pain prior to surgery. The patient was discharged the same day with vascular surgery followup in two weeks. The patient was not started on anticoagulation, as no evidence of actual thrombus formation was seen during her stay. The patient was asymptomatic on the one-month followup, with no episodes of cyanosis or deep venous thrombosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She had no remarkable family or medical history. Menarche had occurred at age of 14 years, with normal regular periods. In February 2011, she was referred to the Humanitas Research Hospital, Milan, for further work-up. After staging procedures, a right radical mastectomy was carried out with no evidence of residual disease at the pathological examination. No adjuvant treatment was delivered.\nIn October 2011, a positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan revealed a pathologic uptake in the right axilla and the patient underwent an axillary dissection. The pathological examination was consistent with lymph node metastasis of high-grade angiosarcoma. From November to December 2011, adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin 25 mg/m2/day and ifosfamide 1 g/m2/day (both on days 1–3) every 21 days was administered. During treatment, the patient reported menstrual irregularities but no amenorrhea.\nIn January 2013, a nodule of the right thoracic wall was surgically removed confirming a relapse of angiosarcoma. Adjuvant radiation therapy was proposed, but the patient refused it.\nIn September 2013, a PET/CT scan revealed a further local relapse along with the involvement of the contralateral axillary lymph nodes for which our patient underwent chemotherapy with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on days 1, 8 every 21 days for 6 cycles, achieving a partial response according to RECIST criteria, followed by surgery.\nIn May 2016, for progressive disease with distant pleuropulmonary metastases and further local recurrence, the patient received pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 on day 1 every 28 days, with stable disease after 3 cycles and disease progression after 6 cycles. Therefore, in November 2016, pazopanib at a dose of 800 mg daily was started. Thyroid function tests at the baseline were within the normal range (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] 2.25 mIU/l with normal range of 0.27–4.20). In December 2016, thyroid monitoring showed an increase in TSH (22.83 mIU/l), a decrease in fT3 1.8 pg/ml (normal range: 2.0–4.4) and normal fT4 10.6 pg/ml (normal range: 9.3–17.1). Anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies were absent. A thyroid ultrasound excluded the presence of nodules or other abnormalities. Levothyroxine replacement therapy was started at a dose of 50 μg daily. In January 2017, secondary amenorrhea occurred. Beta-HCG dosage was negative (2.5 mIU/ml, n.r. 0–5.3). In February 2017, thyroid tests showed a stable TSH level (22.87 mIU/l), and a normalization of fT3 (2.5 pg/ml). Dose of levothyroxine was increased to 75 μg daily. A PET/CT scan showed a complete response of the lung lesions and a partial response of the local relapse. In March 2017, while still on therapy with pazopanib, normal thyroid function was restored (TSH 4.21 mIU/l, fT3 3 pg/ml, fT4 11.9 pg/ml) and reproductive hormone levels were as follows: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was 48 mIU/ml, luteinizing hormone (LH) was 75.8 mIU/ml, and estradiol (E2) was 61 pg/ml. Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) was 3.27 ng/ml (within the lower values of the normal range: normal range: 0.96–13.34 for 18–25-year-old women, 0.03–3.27 for 41–45-year-old women). Antral follicle count (AFC) obtained by trans-vaginal ultrasound revealed a right AFC of 4 and a left AFC of 2 (normal count: 7).[ Based on these data, we diagnosed a primary ovarian insufficiency. In September 2017, a PET/CT scan showed a local progression of disease, pazopanib was stopped and a new treatment with paclitaxel was proposed. After discussion with the patient about possible treatment-related adverse events, patient's refusal of hair-loss inducing therapies and clinical benefit from gemcitabine previously administered, a further line of treatment with gemcitabine was started in October 2017. In November 2017, after 2 months from pazopanib discontinuation, menses returned regularly. Hormonal assays showed FSH 9.2 mIU/ml, LH 10.6 mIU/ml, E2 120 pg/ml, in the follicular phase.\nIn April 2018, the patient experienced further disease progression and paclitaxel-based treatment has been proposed. The patient has provided a written informed consent for the case details to be published; approval from the ethical committee was not necessary, in line with the regulations of our Institution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During childhood and adolescence, she had multiple admissions for painful episodes of bone VOC and infections, but no reported clinical features of affections of the central nervous system. Her steady-state Hb ranged from ∼7 to 8 g/dl; HbS from ∼70 to 80%, and HbF from ∼2 to 11%. She used folic acid (5 mg/day) and intermittently (due to financial constraints) hydroxyurea (0.5–1 g/day).\nTwo years prior to the current admission, a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) angiography was performed as a screening for cerebral infarctions and vasculopathy as part of a research programme. This showed multiple small cerebral infarcts, and the largest (∼3 mm) was located in the right frontal deep white matter (Figures and ). There were no features of skull abnormalities or arteriovenous malformations, and all intracranial arteries were unremarkable.\nShe was first seen at a local hospital before being transported to Muhimbili National Hospital after one day with loss of consciousness. This was preceded by frontal headache three days prior to hospital admission which increased in severity with time. There was no history of trauma, vomiting, convulsions, or urine/fecal incontinence. One week prior to hospital admission, she had bone pain on and off and low-grade fever, which were relieved by analgesia and antipyretics, respectively.\nOn arrival at Muhimbili National Hospital, the patient was unconscious with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 7/15 and febrile (38.9°C), with moderate pallor, but no jaundice. The pupils were dilated and sluggishly reacting to light. In addition, she had developed right-sided hemiparesis. There was no visible evidence of head trauma or signs of meningeal affection.\nA computerized tomography (CT) scan of the brain on admission revealed a massive biconvex extradural heterogeneous (predominantly hyperdense) hematoma (4.37 cm in maximum thickness with 1.23 cm of midline shift) overlying the left frontal and parietal lobes (Figures and ). The hematoma compressed the underlying brain matter so that the gyral and sulci pattern was lost and hypodense indicating edema. Moreover, an effaced ipsilateral lateral ventricle and a moderate dilatation of the contralateral lateral ventricle had developed. A subgaleal hematoma overlying the left frontal and parietal bones was also noted (Figures and ). There was no skull lesion or features or signs of osteomyelitis. In addition, we noted two hypodense lesions consistent with bone infarction on the left frontal and right parietal bones ().\nHer Hb was 5.0 (reference value: 12.0–15.0) g/dl, leukocytes 6.1 (4.0–10.0) × 109/l, and platelets 73.0 (150–410) × 109/l. The concentration of C-reactive protein was elevated (287; 0–5) mg/l, while screenings for malaria, urinary tract, typhoid, and dengue infections were all negative. Additional blood tests revealed no hypercoagulability or bleeding tendency, including normal INR and APTT.\nDue to progressive deterioration of her condition, the patient underwent a left parietal craniotomy and evacuation of the EDH under general anesthesia. She regained consciousness the day after surgery; however, she remained aphasic with right-sided hemiparesis for 3-4 days until her condition started to improve over the next two weeks. She was discharged after 17 days. At the outpatient consultation three months postoperatively, she had no particular complaints and was able to talk normally and walk without support and although not formally tested, there were no apparent language, motor, or cognitive deficits. An MRI brain scan showed (Figures –) (i) no midline shift, marked enlargement of the left lateral ventricle and widening of the sulci on the left frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes and widened left sylvian fissure signifying presence of both subcortical and cortical brain atrophy; (ii) diffuse and focal periventricular white matter hyperintensities along the body and posterior horn of the lateral ventricle which may signify cerebral spinal fluid seepage or reperfusion infarcts; and (iii) left parietal bone signal changes which may be craniotomy-associated changes or bone infarction. There were no changes of the small cerebral infarcts on the right frontal lobe deep white matter compared to those observed in 2017. MRI angiography was normal with no features of arteriovenous malformations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both parents were 32 years old at her birth. Her older sister was healthy. She was born small for gestational age (SGA) at 35 gestational weeks by vaginal delivery. Birth weight was 1100 g and body length was 41 cm. Developmental delay with short stature and low body weight, moderate scoliosis and a very mild intellectual disability with delayed speech have been noticed since her childhood. Spontaneous thelarche occurred at age of 11 years and menarche at the age of 14 years. The menses were always present even if irregular in rhythm. Daily subcutaneous rGH therapy at dose of 0.2 mg/kg/week was started at the age of 4 years because of SGA (clonidine GH stimulation test was: GH peak value of 11 ng/ml; arginine GH stimulation test was: GH peak value of 16 ng/mL); at that time, her weight was 11 kg (− 2.7 SD score) and her height was 90 cm (− 2.9 SD score) with a target height of 169.5 cm (+ 1.25 SD score). The 3 years follow-up growth parameters did not reveal any improvement; therefore at the age of 7 years the dose was increased to 0.3 mg/kg/week, as Variant of Turner Syndrome.\nMetaphase chromosome analysis from peripheral blood lymphocytes culture and GTG banding was performed using standard protocol. Cytogenetic analysis showed a female karyotype containing additional material on one X chromosome. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with arm-specific probes (chromoprobe, Cytocell) and subtelomeric Xp and Xq probes (Vysis) allowed detection of the Xp and Xq regions on the duplicated X chromosome. The karyotype was then described as 46,X dup(X) (q21.31 → q28) (Fig. a and b). In order to better define the exact extent of duplication and to deepen the origin of the developmental delay and the short stature, she performed oligonucleotide-based array comparative genomic hybridization which showed partial trisomy and tetrasomy Xq [arr Xq21.31(89,594,027-89,837,847) × 3,Xq21.31(89,853,144-90,222,617) × 4,Xq21.31q28(90,254,419-155,257,082) × 3] with a 65 Mb duplication.\nWhen she was 18 years old the weight was 42,7 Kg (− 2 DS score) and her height was 153,2 cm (− 1 DS score): physical examination showed general facial hypotonia and nistagmus, long face with tall chin, hypotrophy of the lower extremities, widely spaced teeth, complete pubertal development (Tanner stage 5) and a moderate scoliosis for which surgery was recommended. Her follow-up shows improvement in her growth parameters (Fig. a and b).\nA formal cognitive evaluation was performed for the first time at 15 years old: the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III) revealing a total IQ of 77 (Verbal IQ: 81, Performance IQ: 79). Further neuropsychological evaluations highlighted the presence of a nonverbal learning disability. By age of 18 neurological evaluation remarked only a slight motor clumsiness. An electroencephalogram recorded at the same age both in wakefulness and sleep did not reveal any abnormalities. Overall, the patient’s cognitive level is sufficient to guarantee satisfactory daily activity and learning.\nLaboratory test at 3rd day of menstrual cycle showed: FSH 7,8 mIU/mL, (normal 1.5–11 mIU/ml), LH 4.51 mIU/ml (normal 1–25), estradiol 104 ng/L (normal 70–530) TSH 1.28 mIU/mL (normal 0.35–3 mIU/mL), AMH 0,39 ng/dl (abnormal < 1 ng/dl) and IGF1 50 nmol/L (normal 33–62). Ultrasound examination performed by transabdominal approach showed the presence of regular uterus and ovaries with an AFC (Antral Follicle Count) of 3.\nHormonal and ultrasound examinations were compatible with a severely reduced ovarian reserve, with AMH and AFC both <5th centile for age. Considering ovarian reserve results, a counselling about available fertility preservation strategies was done. Since both the patient and her parents showed interest in this opportunity, further multidisciplinary evaluations were performed before to proceed. Risks, methods and limits of the procedure were explained, especially regarding the paucity of data about success, genetic transmission risks and the possibility to perform a Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) in the future. Finally, patient’s psycho-intellectual adequacy and her understanding of the proposed procedure were confirmed, and adequate time for decision was given to patient.\nA cardiological examination with no contraindications detected, at time of evaluation, for future pregnancies was also performed.\nThe patient and her parents decided to proceed. After controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) three oocytes were obtained; two of them were in Metaphase II and were cryopreserved with vitrification. Further COS cycles are planned according to patient’s and her parents’ wills, in order to increase the number of oocytes to be preserved.\nResults of these literature findings are summarized in the discussion. Our aim is to evaluate a possible correlation between genetic test results and clinic outcomes as well as to suggest possible management strategies for fertility, genetic and endocrinology specialists.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She received a total of 12 mg of IV lorazepam, a lorazepam infusion titrated to 15 mg/hr, and a propofol infusion (30 mcg/kg/min at time of transport arrival). Given persistent seizure activity, she was given a total of phenobarbital 650 mg.\nHer laboratory values were significant for sodium of 140 mEq/L, 3.2 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L, carbon dioxide 23 mEq/L, BUN 7 mg/dL creatinine0.7 mg/dL, glucose 141 mg/dL, AST 22 units/L, ALT 17 units/L. Her salicylate, acetaminophen, and ethanol concentrations were undetectable. Her urine drug screen was negative for amphetamines, benzodiaze-pines, THC, cocaine, methadone, opiates, oxycodone, and buprenorphine. Her ECG at the initial hospital showed sinus tachycardia 155 bpm without QRS widening.\nDuring transfer to a receiving hospital, propofol and lorazepam infusions were discontinued, and she received 1 mg of lorazepam and a total of 100 mcg of fentanyl. She also was started on norepinephrine en route for hypotension (79/47 mmHg) (the nadir of her BP in transport was 65/27 mmHg) and she responded well to norepinephrine.\nOn arrival to the receiving hospital, she had sluggishly reactive pupils, present corneal reflexes, absent gag reflex, hypotonia with no volitional movements, no response to painful stimulus, no hyperreflexia, and no clonus. Her initial ECG at the receiving hospital showed a sinus rhythm of 96 bpm with a QRS of 117 ms, QT 394 ms, and QTcB of 497 ms. She received 50 mEq of sodium bicarbonate for QRS prolongation greater than 100 ms, and her repeat QRS was 116 ms which narrowed to 102 ms approximately 6 h later without further intervention. She received 2 grams of magnesium for a magnesium concentration of 1.5 mg/dL. Her serum calcium was 7.6 mg/dL (ionized 1.06 mmol/L) and normalized without intervention. Her QTc normalization 2 days later which was not correlated with the normalization of magnesium or calcium. She required norepinephrine intermittently for blood pressure support (max dose 0.15 mcg/kg/min) for approximately 2 days after admission to the receiving center. The patient had no known dysrhythmias. Her EEG showed no epileptiform activity from approximately 11 h–32 h post ingestion.\nAt the receiving hospital, her serum lamotrigine concentration was 109 mcg/mL (reference 3.0–14.0 mcg/mL) approximately 7 h after ingestion. Her serum trazodone concentration was 2.2 mcg/mL (ref. 0.50–2.50 mcg/mL) and serum buspirone concentration was undetectable approximately 15 h after ingestion. Her serum bupropion concentration was 92 ng/mL (reference 50–100 ng/mL) approximately 20 h after ingestion. Subsequent lamotrigine concentrations declined to 10.2 mcg/mL and 2.5 mcg/mL at 3 and 6 days later, respectively. She was extubated on hospital day 5 and discharged to a psychiatric facility on hospital day 13.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient had never experienced any abdominal trauma and never undergone abdominal surgery.\nShe was investigated with a new CT-scan of abdomen and pelvis that showed a multi-infarcted pelvic splenomegaly (max diameter 13,5 cm), compressing the womb and the bladder, and a typical “whirl sign” of the splenic vascular pedicle (, ). No radiological signs of portal hypertension were found, but was reported huge ectasia of the splenic veins and collateral tributaries (). Angio-CT reconstruction was performed to study in details the vascularization of the spleen ().\nShe underwent hematological evaluation revealing normocromic normocytic anemia and piastrinopenia compatible with the multi-infarcted spleen. Also an Helicobater Pylori gastritis was found and treated by eradication therapy.\nA physical examination of the abdomen revealed a tender pelvic mass, changing position with the variation of the patient decubitus.\nThe patient was candidated to a laparoscopic elective splenectomy due to her symptoms, the spleen dimension, the risk of splenic infarctions and potential obstacle to a future pregnancy. She received a prophylaxis therapy with triple vaccine against Haemophilus Influenzae, Pneumococcus and Meningococcus three weeks before surgery.\nAn explorative laparoscopy confirmed the presence of a bulky multi-infarcted spleen completely obstructing the pelvis. The vascular pedicle was composed of a big artery originating as usual from the celiac trunk and some enormous veins draining into the superior mesenteric branch. Because of the unusual position and weight of the spleen and its vessels, also the tail of the pancreas was innaturally tractioned medially and inferiorly towards the lower abdomen. Furthermore the pancreas appeared to be in abnormal position, resulting anterior to the mesocolon and intraperitoneally located.\nThe Sustentaculum lienis (freno-colic, colic and freno-splenic ligaments) was under-developed; the splenic pedicle was twirled around its long axis several times and the tail of pancreas was partially involved in the torsion without any chance of derotation. To avoid the risk of complications, like vein thrombosis or bleeding from the ectasic tributaries of the splenic vein, we decided to dissect the splenic pedicle in proximity of the tail of pancreas preserving the pancreatic vessels.\nA laparoscopic dissection and ligature of the splenic artery was performed, obtaining a volume reduction of the spleen. We than continued with the ligation of some ectasic splenic veins and finally, we extracted the specimen from a 5cm periumbilical incision and completed the separation of the splenic pedicle from the pancreatic tail (, ).\nAfter splenectomy, the tail of pancreas was left in its innatural position, above the left colic flexure. A peripancreatic drainage was placed. (Supplemental Digital Content: Video)\nSupplementary video related to this article can be found at .\nThe following is the supplementary data related to this article:\nIn order to reduce the risk of postoperative pancreatitis, we started intraoperative octreotide, extended during the all hospitalization.\nThe post-operative recovery of the patient was uneventful and she was discharged after 6 days.\nLaboratory investigations showed a postoperative stability of hemoglobin level and a progressive increased platelet count.\nGiven the risk of thrombotic events, prophylaxis with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was started 24 hours before undergoing surgery and continued for 1 month.\nHistopathological examination revealed a spleen measuring 15 cm (maximum diameter), weighing 576 g, with multiple twist of the pedicle, which was revealed to be 45 cm long. The microscopic examination showed multiple hemorrhagic infarctions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RonALD cLaRK,18,F,A+,Asthma,09-06-2019,Karen Rice,Potter PLC,Medicare,40951.53046,388,Urgent,10-06-2019,Lipitor,Normal,"Section 1—An 18-year-old woman presented with severe cachexia, weighing 27.2 kg and a Body mass index (BMI) of 12, with no known history of anorexia nervosa. She was healthy and a professional gymnast until the age of 14, when she got her tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap). Four days after receiving the immunization, she developed local reactions with tenderness, redness, and swelling at the vaccine injection site as well as daily systemic fevers and headaches. The headaches became worsen with exercises. After one week, the symptoms disappeared, except for a persistent headache. She then presented with episodes of dizziness of 30 s to 5 min in duration, which disturbed her training lessons, and after an episode of syncope with a head trauma, she was forced to leave the activity. The symptoms remained the same until one year later when they became worse. On top of the headaches and dizziness, she experienced arthralgia, especially on her hips, shoulders, and knees; myalgia, extreme fatigue, orthostatic intolerance, mouth ulcers and new food and pollen allergies, symptoms that she still deals with. The patient then consulted a rheumatologist who prescribed her daily hydroxychloroquine under the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\nSection 2—Four years after the vaccine, when she presented to us, she also complained of early satiety, chronic constipation and abdominal pain, visual changes, foggy brain, sleep disturbance, prickly sensations, and paresthesia. She is now extremely cachectic (), with a weight loss of around 25 kg since the vaccine four years ago. On her examination, she had bradycardia, but apart from that, a normal physical examination, including the neurological examination. Most of her routine, metabolic, hormonal, and immune laboratory workups were between the normal ranges, including ANA, p-ANCA, c-ANCA, antiRo, antiLa (that were not detected), and complement levels. The exceptions were the presence of antihistones, a high immunoglobulin E level, a slightly elevated ESR, and high titers of tetanus antibodies. She was not tested for antineuronal antibodies. Glucose and hemoglobin A1C were normal. Celiac serology and cancer markers were negative. All imaging testing, that included a total body CT scan with and without contrast and a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), were interpreted as normal. Both an optical coherence tomography (OCT) and a Humphrey visual field examination showed no abnormalities. Endoscopic exams did not show absorption disorders or other findings that could explain the clinical picture. A gastric emptying study showed 22% of the normal emptying rate. The psychiatric evaluation did not disclose any mental origin for the eating disorder. She was put on parenteral nutrition with a slow improvement of her weight. She received the diagnosis of autoimmune/anti-inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA; Shoenfeld’s syndrome) following the Tdap vaccine, with an important component of dysautonomia that explains most of her complaints, including gastroparesis and, consequently, extreme cachexia ( and ).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was no history of fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or urinary tract infection.\nPast medical history was unremarkable for diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, or other autoimmune diseases. She was not known to have hyperthyroidism in the past. Pregnancy had been uneventful except for persistent episodes of emesis for past one month. There was no prior history of mood symptoms or altered mental status. There was no history of heat intolerance, diarrhea, or weight loss. There was no recent history of usage of corticosteroid, loop or thiazide diuretic, strenuous exercise, vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge of grape-like vesicles, seizures, alcohol intake, and carbohydrate load. Family history was notable only for type 2 diabetes in the father. There was no known family history of autoimmune diseases, thyroid disorders, hypokalemia, and periodic paralysis. There was no consanguinity.\nVital signs upon presentation showed blood pressure (BP) 142/87 mm Hg, pulse 120 beats per minute, oral temperature 38.9 °C (102.02 °F), respiratory rate 18 per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her height was 172.7 cm and weight was 109 kg (240 lb 4.8 oz). Physical examination was remarkable for an overweight female who was awake but slow to respond. There was no goiter and ophthalmopathy. There was mild scleral icterus. There was no tremor or pretibial edema.\nSerum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level was 246,000 mIU/mL and sonogram confirmed the presence of a single viable intrauterine fetus of approximately 15 weeks gestation with expected uterine size. Renal function test showed sodium 127 mmol/L, potassium 2.5 mmol/L, bicarbonate 33 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 123 mg/dL, serum creatinine 4.2 mg/dL (MDRD estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 17 mL/min/1.73 m2), calcium 9.5 mg/dL, phosphorus 2.7 mg/dL and magnesium of 1 mg/dL. Liver function test showed aspartate aminotransferase 140 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 203 IU/L, total bilirubin 2.9 mg/dL, ammonia 55 µmol/L, and serum albumin 3.1 gm/dl. Renal function test two months prior to pregnancy showed normal serum creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL (MDRD eGFR 113 mL/min/1.73 m2) and normal electrolytes (serum sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, bicarbonate 24 mmol/L, calcium 9.4 mg/dL, phosphorus 3.9 mg/dL, and magnesium was not available) Serum creatine kinase was normal at 121 U/L (normal 0–180 U/L). Urine sodium was <10 mmol/L, urine creatinine 84 mg/dL, urine potassium 28 mmol/L and urine osmolality was 344 mOsm/kg. Fractional excretion of sodium was 0.4%. Urinalysis showed 1+ proteinuria, no microscopic hematuria, 5 white cells per high power field, no ketonuria, pH 5, specific gravity of 1.015, and negative nitrites and leukocytes. Plasma renin activity was 14 ng/mL/h (normal 0.5–4 ng/mL/h, upright) and serum aldosterone was 13 ng/dL (normal 4–31 ng/dL, upright). Blood and urine cultures were negative. Other extensive investigations for infectious etiologies were also negative. Urine for Chlamydia and Neisseria was negative. SARS-CoV-2 DNA PCR from the nasopharyngeal swab was negative. Other labs were notable for undetectable thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level < 0.030 mIU/L (reference 0.4–5 mIU/L), total T3 238 ng/dL (reference 87–178 ng/dL), and free T4 > 6.99 ng/dL (reference 0.6–1.2 ng/dL). Computed tomography of the head showed no acute intracranial abnormalities.\nInitial management included administration of intravenous fluids (IVF), propranolol, potassium iodide, propylthiouracil (PTU), and hydrocortisone. A presumptive diagnosis of hyperemesis gravidarum with thyroid storm and AKI secondary to persistent emesis was made. She met criteria for thyroid storm due to elevated serum free T4 and total T3 with undetected TSH, along with pyrexia, tachycardia, icterus, and altered mental status. Her clinical condition improved somewhat after receiving PTU, propranolol, and hydrocortisone as heart rate, blood pressure, and free T4 began to decrease. Her mental status improved and she became more alert and engaged in conversation. Given tachycardia and hypertension, she was started on propranolol 60 mg every 4 hours which was later converted to 160 mg daily.\nOther thyroid studies showed thyroid peroxidase antibody 0.3 IU/mL (reference < 9 IU/mL), TSH receptor antibody (TRAb) < 0.90 (reference < 1.75 IU/L), and undetected thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) of < 0.10 (reference ≤ 0.54 IU/L). Given negative TRAb, Graves’ disease was highly unlikely. Serum free T4 normalized in ten days, TSH in two weeks and total T3 in five days. Given pregnancy, further modalities including radioactive iodine uptake study were not pursued, given risk of fetal hypothyroidism, mental retardation, and increased risk of malignancy. Partial molar pregnancy was initially considered due to presentation of thyroid storm, however, the beta-hCG level was trending down and the patient did not show any signs of pre-eclampsia. Thyroid sonogram showed normal sized thyroid with homogenous thyroid texture and without increased vascularity, making Grave’s disease unlikely. Investigations for AKI included renal sonogram which showed right kidney measuring 12.8 cm in length and left kidney measuring 12.6 cm in length with bilateral normal cortical echogenicity without evidence of hydronephrosis or nephrocalcinosis. Hepatic sonogram showed gallbladder sludge. A chest X-ray was normal without pulmonary edema or cardiomegaly. Electrocardiogram showed normal Q-T interval. Echocardiogram was normal with ejection fraction of 65%. Cardiac enzymes were normal.\nPTU was later changed to methimazole as she was no longer in the first trimester of pregnancy and as she demonstrated signs of liver insufficiency. Anti-emetics and IVF were discontinued after few days as the patient was able to tolerate well by mouth. Hydrocortisone was discontinued after two days. Subsequently, propranolol was discontinued along with methimazole, as the beta-hCG mediated hyperemesis was thought to be the likely etiology of thyroid symptoms. Her vital signs, including BPs, remained stable and her thyroid levels returned to normal without anti-thyroid drugs. Serum beta-hCG at discharge was 175,557 mIU/mL. Given decreasing level of hCG without other signs or symptoms of gestational trophoblastic disease, molar pregnancy was unlikely. She was discharged without any thyroid medications.\nDuring the hospitalization, her serum potassium remained around 2.4–2.9 meq/L along with serum bicarbonate 30–38 meq/L despite resolution of emesis. Serum magnesium remained low, as well as with values ranging from 1–1.4 mg/dL. Twenty-four hour urine collection showed a urine calcium of 0.04 mg/kg/day. Random urine calcium to creatinine ratio was also low at 0.005. She required multiple intravenous potassium and magnesium supplements. Discharge serum potassium and magnesium was 3.5 meq/L and 1.2 mg/dL, respectively. She was discharged on magnesium oxide 400 mg daily and potassium chloride 10 meq twice daily. BUN and serum creatinine slowly improved with intravenous hydration. Kidney biopsy was not performed and renal replacement therapy was not required. Discharge BUN and serum creatinine was 15 mg/dL and 0.97 mg/dL (MDRD eGFR 90 mL/min/1.73 m2), respectively. Due to the persistent hypokalemia, alkalosis, hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria despite resolution of emesis, a genetic testing by next generation sequence analysis was done which showed that the patient was homozygous in the SLCA123 (NM_001126108.2) gene for a known sequence variant designated c.2581C>T (p.Arg861Cys) (Prevention Genetics, Marshfield, WI, USA). No further in vitro functional studies were performed, hence the exact functional implication of this variant was unknown. However, to determine the pathogenicity of this variant, in silico tests were performed using SIFT, PolyPhen-2, FATHMM and MutationTaster. The resulting prediction utilizing these in silico tools was “Pathogenic”. At 37 weeks gestation, a healthy infant of 3.5 kilograms was born vaginally without any perinatal complications. The serum creatinine remained stable at 0.7 mg/dL after delivery (MDRD eGFR 132 mL/min/1.73 m2).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She presented with low-grade fever in 1 month prior to the current visit. There was no history of dyspnea, palpitations, dizziness, visual disturbances or carotidynia. She visited a local hospital and also reported claudication of the left leg. Clinical examination revealed bruits over the left femoral arteries, and laboratory data indicated increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). She was diagnosed with TA according to the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria for TA.[ Initially, she was treated with oral prednisolone (PSL) (40 mg/day) and the increased levels of CRP were normalized. Finally, PSL was tapered to 10 mg/day. She was referred to our hospital for maintenance therapy due to movement problems. In the first visit to our hospital, intermittent claudication improved partially, however she recognized claudication symptoms after walking more than 100 m.\nUpon physical examination, the pulse rate was 88 bpm. Radial pulses were normal and equally palpable on both sides. A bruit was audible over the inguinal region on the left side without any carotid, renal or abdominal bruits. Hematology and biochemistry (Table ) revealed no abnormality except increased serum amyloid A (SAA) (53.4 μg/mL) and CRP level (1.26 mg/dL). Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) were positive with low titers (1:80), and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) were negative. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed the stenosis of the left femoral artery (Fig. , case 1).\nOwing to sustained intermittent claudication and relapse of increased levels of CRP, additional immunosuppressive treatments were required. We decided to increase the dose of PSL (10 mg/day → 20 mg/day), and the increased levels of CRP fell to within normal ranges. However, intermittent claudication was not controlled completely by GCs therapy, and elevated levels of SAA (20.7 μg/mL) were still observed. Hence, we introduced TCZ treatment in combination with maintenance GCs therapy. We tried to taper the PSL dose under the concomitant TCZ treatment with stable dose (subcutaneous injections, 162 mg/week). Serum levels of SAA were normalized (<2.5 μg/mL) within 3 weeks from the start of TCZ treatment. During this treatment periods, PSL dose was gradually tapered. Six months after starting TCZ, contrast-enhanced CT revealed a marked reduction of stenosis in the left femoral artery. Also, the ankle–brachial index (ABI) showed an increase in blood pressure of the lower extremities (Fig. , case 1). One year after starting TCZ treatment, the patient remained asymptomatic even after walking >2 km and there are no relapsing signs of TA. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6 (measured using a Human IL-6 ELISA kit; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) showed high levels (27.5 pg/mL) before initiation of TCZ treatment. Serum levels of IL-6 increased transiently, but declined to the lower levels (10–20 pg/mL) at 12 weeks from the start of TCZ treatment (Fig. ). TCZ treatment had been continued and there was no TCZ-related adverse effect at the time of this writing. Doses of PSL were tapered gradually to the maintenance dose (11 mg/day), which was accompanied without disease flare.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The breathing difficulties had started one year before by exertional dyspnea and progressed until hospitalization. There was no additional medical history, no familial history, and no parental consanguinity. The patient rapidly needed mechanical ventilation because of ineffective Non-invasive ventilation (NIV).\nThe clinical examination showed a weakness of bilateral interossei muscles at 3/5 MRC score in upper limbs and of bilateral psoas-iliac and tibialis anterior muscles in lower limbs at 4/5. Amyotrophy was observed in distal four limbs (Fig. A), not associated with fasciculations. Reflexes were all present. There was no pyramidal syndrome. There was no sensory disorder and no cranial nerve involvement. Her clinical examination remained stable during her 6 weeks stay in intensive care.\nMotor nerve conduction study found compound motor action potentials of decreased amplitude in four limbs with normal conduction velocities (Table ); there was no decrement on repetitive nerve stimulation; sensory conduction was normal; needle examination showed spontaneous activity (i.e., fibrillation potentials and/or positive sharp waves) and neurogenic recruitment in bilateral interossei and tibialis anterior muscles arguing for a MND; fasciculation potentials were absent (Table ).\nAll biological investigations were normal, notably auto-immune, infectious and metabolic markers including CSF examination, acylcarnitine profile, and riboflavin in blood. Brain and spinal cord MRIs were normal, as the thoraco-abdominal CT scan. The muscle biopsy showed only abnormalities related to a pure neurogenic disease.\nAn Ig IV treatment was given at 2 g/kg the day after her hospitalization to treat potential auto-immune disease (Guillain-Barré syndrome), with no observed efficiency. After 1 month with failure to wean mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy was decided, and a high dose per os riboflavin trial (15 mg/kg) was initiated. Her clinical condition then very slowly improved – tracheostomy removal was possible 7 months after treatment onset (M7) with discontinuation of diurnal ventilation but need for nocturnal NIV; at M16 she only used nocturnal NIV three nights a week; at M20 she could totally stop NIV with no sign of hypoventilation when evaluated after 1 month (notably normal pCO2 after night sleep). Vital Capacity was measured at 1690mL at M4, increased at 2730 mL (+67%) at M15. Limb weakness did not obviously improve whereas motor nerve conduction study showed a slightly improvement after 1 year, mostly in lower limbs (Table ). She was independent for all daily activities.\nUsing a next generation sequencing (NGS) approach targeting exons and exon–intron boundaries, genetic investigations for RTD revealed a never-reported likely pathogenic heterozygous missense variant in SLC52A3 gene c.113G > C (see Table for in silico data), classified as a variant of unknown significance type 4 (VUS 4). Gene dosage anomalies have been excluded as our bioinformatic pipeline allows for copy number variation (CNV) detection. Familial segregation study was not possible but both parents were alive and healthy. No mutation was identified in ALS genes (NGS for FUS, TARDP, and SOD1, and hexanucleotide repeat analysis for C9ORF72 were performed). To assess further the RTD diagnosis, as only one likely pathogenic variant was found, auditory and visual explorations were performed whereas there was no patient’s complaint. Pure-tone audiometry test showed a bilateral sensorineural hearing loss with an air-conduction average of 62 and 43 dB for the right and the left ear, respectively (Fig. B–C). The absence of compound action potentials on auditory brainstem response and the presence of otoacoustic emissions confirmed the diagnosis of auditory neuropathy. Evoked visual potentials were also abnormal with low and delayed potentials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Histopathologic evaluation showed papillary projections lined by hyperplastic squamous epithelium around fibrovascular cores (Figure ). The hyperplastic squamous epithelium is composed of elongated hyperchromatic nuclei with eosinophilic cytoplasm (Figure ) suggestive of benign squamous papilloma. Four weeks after the surgical excision, normal healing and normal restoration of the uvular shape were seen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, she reported a 3-day history of severe chest pain, together with a productive cough and fever as high as 38 °C. She reported no reduction in urine volume and no recent history of skin infection or tonsillitis. On physical examination, she was found to be very pallid and normotensive (blood pressure, 130/80 mmHg), with a heart rate of 104 bpm, a respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air, as well as being found to have developed anasarca. One month prior, she had undergone outpatient laboratory tests, which had shown that her renal function was normal—with a serum creatinine concentration of 0.75 mg/dl and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), as determined by the Chronic Kidney Disease–Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD–EPI) equation, of 134.9 ml/min/1.73 m2—urine analysis showing no haematuria or proteinuria.\nBlood tests performed at admission to the emergency room revealed the following: haemoglobin, 6.1 g/dl; haematocrit, 18.8%; haptoglobin, < 10 mg/dl; reticulocyte fraction, 6.11%; no schistocytes; lactate dehydrogenase, 433 U/L; indirect bilirubin, 0.36 mg/dl; leucocyte count, 18,820 cells/mm3; neutrophil count, 13,630 cells/mm3; lymphocyte count, 2790 cells/mm3; platelet count, 622;000 cells/mm3; and urea, 29 mg/dl. The patient showed signs of hyperfiltration, including a serum creatinine concentration of 0.49 mg/dl and a CKD–EPI-determined eGFR of 148.5 ml/min/1.73 m2, although no hydroelectrolytic or acid-base disorders were identified. A urine sample was found to contain 100 leucocytes/field and 70 erythrocytes/field. In addition, 24-h proteinuria was 8.99 g. Further analysis of the blood samples showed the following: total proteins, 3.9 g/dl; albumin, 1.2 g/dl; globulins, 2.7 g/dl; total cholesterol, 210 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein, 114 mg/dl; high-density lipoprotein, 37 mg/dl; triglycerides, 205 mg/dl; C4, 26.1 mg/dl (normal range, 10–38 mg/dl); C3, 62 mg/dl (normal range, 73–149 mg/dl); C-reactive protein, 24.9 mg/dl (normal range, < 5 mg/dl). The serology was negative for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. The patient also tested negative for antinuclear factor, anti-DNA, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Serum protein electrophoresis showed hypoalbuminaemia and an anti-streptolysin O level of 816 IU/ml (normal range, < 200 IU/ml). Blood and urine cultures were negative. A chest X-ray showed mild congestion and infiltrate in the right lung base. Ultrasound of the kidneys and urinary tract showed that the kidneys were normal in size and appearance.\nGiven the clinical presentation, the diagnostic hypothesis was pneumonia and anasarca due to nephritic-nephrotic syndrome. The patient was started on ceftriaxone (1 g, twice daily). Computed tomography angiography of the chest ruled out pulmonary thromboembolism and acute chest syndrome, thus indirectly confirming the diagnosis of pneumonia.\nAfter the infection had been controlled, the patient underwent renal biopsy. Light microscopy revealed 7 glomeruli with global endocapillary proliferation; neutrophil and macrophage infiltrate (Fig. a); synechiae in 10% of the glomeruli; occasional splitting of the glomerular basement membrane; and a preserved Bowman’s capsule. The tubules were dilated, with foci of epithelial regeneration and neutrophils within their lumina. There was focal oedema in the interstitium. The interlobular arteries had a normal aspect, with intimal proliferation in the arterioles. Immunofluorescence performed on frozen sections showed intensity of deposition of C3 (2+/3+), IgG (1+/3+), IgA (1+/3+) and lambda light chains (1+/3+), with a granular pattern, distributed diffusely throughout the capillary loop. Collectively, the histological findings were consistent with a diagnosis of APIGN accompanied by microangiopathic changes related to the underlying disease.\nTreatment with a diuretic and an anti-proteinuric agent (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) was instituted, and the patient evolved to clinical improvement (normalisation of blood pressure, as well as resolution of the proteinuria and haematuria). However, the signs of hyperfiltration persisted even after resolution of the proteinuria. In the final evaluation, the serum creatinine concentration was 0.33 mg/dl and the CKD–EPI-determined eGFR was 187.8 ml/min/1.73 m2.

RAyMond KliNe,18,F,AB-,Hypertension,17-10-2021,Thomas Garcia,Duarte-Wallace,Cigna,25294.9119,183,Emergency,05-11-2021,Ibuprofen,Inconclusive,"In November 2017, an 18-year-old female patient presented to the neuropsychiatry department with a week history of progressive lower limb weakness. The patient reported a history of large joints (knee and elbow) arthralgia, for which she received occasional analgesics. There was no malar rash or oral ulcers by examination. She recalled no family history of a similar complaint and had a negative history of illicit drug use or alcohol consumption. Also, she reported a past history of splenectomy as a therapeutic measure for immune thrombocytopenia. The patient had vital signs within normal range. Laboratory evaluation revealed severe hypokalemia (1.5 mmol/L). Electrolyte assessment (serum Na, mg, ionized ca) and thyroid function tests (TSH = 1.18; FT4 = 2.1; FT3 = 1.34) were within normal. She had no history of vomiting or diarrhea. Moreover, electromyography (EMG) demystified mild acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP). Eventually, the patient was diagnosed with hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Accordingly, she received potassium chloride (100 meq; IV infusion) and was eventually discharged after improvement.\nFour months later, the patient was readmitted with a similar attack. Again, the blood workup revealed metabolic acidosis with a potassium level of 2.28 mEq/L and a normal serum anion gap (11 mEq/L). Causes of hypochloremic acidosis like severe diarrhea were excluded. Urine analysis showed alkaline urine (pH 7.5). The patient condition ameliorated after receiving intravenous sodium bicarbonate and potassium infusion. The diagnosis of hypokalemia secondary to distal RTA was considered; then, she was discharged after being scheduled for follow-up in the general internal medicine clinic. In our patient, we did not perform urinary anion gap calculation since the patient was diagnosed with RTA based on normal serum anion gap, metabolic acidosis, exclusion of vomiting and diarrhea, high urinary potassium. Correction of metabolic acidosis was conducted by NaHco3 which confirmed that it is distal RTA not proximal one. Ultrasound revealed no nephrolithiasis in our patient.\nThroughout her follow-up, the patient was persistently hypokalemic (K level 2-3 mEq/L) with a mild metabolic acidosis (blood pH = 7.17, HCO3\n=10.5 mmol/L) and urinary potassium level of 25.8 mEq/L/day. Serum aldosterone and diurnal variation of cortisol were normal. Complete blood count showed persistent leucopenia (TLC 2800-3500/cumm). Serum urea and creatinine were within normal. The 24-hour urinary protein was 1540 mg. The autoimmune workup revealed positive both Anti-double stranded DNA antibody (anti-dsDNA) (225 IU/mL) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer (1/300). Complement proteins C3 and C4 were markedly consumed: 55 mg/dL and 8 mg/dL, respectively. Renal biopsy revealed lupus nephritis, the mesangioproliferative type. The persistent hypokalemic weakness improved dramatically on administering a dose of 40 mg prednisolone daily. Also, the serum potassium level and acidosis normalized with administering sodium bicarbonate and potassium. This emphasized the diagnosis of secondary distal RTA due to systemic lupus erythematosus.\nA search of databases mentioned above revealed a total of 196 relevant articles. Of which, only 26 case reports fit our selection criteria. So, a total of 26 cases were included, including the presented case (Figure ).\nData from 26 case reports entailing 33 patients were extracted and analyzed. The mean age of the population in these reports was 28.7 years. The overall number of females was 30 (90.9%), and they presented with a multitude of manifestations. Twenty-six cases were eventually diagnosed with type-one/distal RTA whereas only six patients were diagnosed with type-four RTA; our case was type 1 as well. The symptoms at presentation varied greatly between isolated neurologic weakness of the lower limbs, as evident in our case, progressive weakness of both upper and lower limbs, generalized flaccid paralysis, or generalized weakness with massive weight loss. Also, the onset of diagnosis of SLE and RTA in relation to each other had a great variation: SLE has been diagnosed in 13 cases at a point varying from one week to 10 years before diagnosing RTA. Whereas eight cases were diagnosed with SLE at points ranging from one month to six years after diagnosing RTA. Simultaneous diagnosis of SLE and RTA was evident in 11 patients. Of note, our patient was diagnosed with SLE during the RTA follow-up (Table ).\nMost articles have reported PH-related and potassium values. Serum PH was within normal range (7.35-7.45) in three cases; meanwhile, 20 cases were acidotic (<7.35), having 10 unreported serum pH values. Also, serum Hco3- has fallen within the normal range (22-28 mEq/L) in one patient, and it was subnormal (<22 mEq/L) in 23 cases, having extra nine unreported patient values. Regarding serum potassium level, aside from four unreported values, three cases had a normal range (3.5-5 mEq/L), 17 cases were hypokalemic (<3.5 mEq/L), and nine were hyperkalemic (<5 mEq/L). Scrutinizing the urinary PH, excluding 12 unreported values, 11 cases had normal urinary pH (6-7.4), three cases had acidotic urine (>6), and seven patients had alkalotic urine (>7.4).\nHistopathological exams revealed membranous glomerulonephritis in five patients and diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis in other five patients. However, the result of kidney biopsy was not reported in 14 patients. Fifteen patients reported no complications, while hypokalemic paralysis and nephrocalcinosis detected in four and eight cases, respectively. Moreover, renal failure was noticed in four patients. Most of the patients received immunosuppressive drugs, steroids, and/or electrolytes. Only one patient reported death complication while most of the patients (n = 24) improved or at least showed remission of symptoms then were discharged. The outcome was not clearly declared in seven cases (Table ).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AriANA roBERtSon,18,F,B+,Diabetes,09-02-2020,Stacie Hardin,"Conway Harper, and Ochoa",Aetna,18483.05051,201,Emergency,05-03-2020,Aspirin,Inconclusive,"We present the case of a 18-year-old female with 10 years history of SLE referred to pain clinic for progressive, localized, dull and non-irradiated pain in both knees for over 12 months, with difficulty weight bearing particularly on the right side leading to limping and impaired walk. The pain was constant during the day and often at night, aggravated during walk and stair climbing, and partially relieved with rest. No neurological symptoms including numbness or paresthesias in lower extremities or bowel and bladder dysfunction were reported. One year before BMAC treatment, the patient was neither a drinker nor smoker, and did not report any noticeable weight change.\nThe patient was diagnosed in 2009 with SLE and when first seen was on a protocol of 10 mg of prednisone daily. SLE flare ups endured for periods of 4 weeks, then reduced gradually over 4 weeks and then halted. Patient had an average of 1 flare up every 6 months for a total average annual cumulative dose of 784 mg/years. Past medical history included glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis, cataracts and macrophage activation syndrome. There was no known history of significant traumas to the knees. Patient's past surgical history was negative. Patient's medications were hydroxychloroquine 200 mg po daily, levetiracetam 750 mg po twice a week for SLE related seizures, prednisone 10 mg po once daily, calcium carbonate 1,250 mg po twice daily, cholecalciferol 2000 IU po daily, ferrous fumarate 300 mg po twice daily, ramipril 7.5 mg po as needed when elevated blood pressure. Before the treatment patient had Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate: 34 mm.h, C-Reactive Protein: 3.5 mg/L, Complement component 3: 1.2 g/L, Complement component 4: 0.23 g/L, ANA titers within normal limits, dsDNA: 13.4 IU/ml, Rheumatoid factor autoantibody: 10 μ/ml, and anti-Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide: 8 μ/ml.\nPhysical examination of the lower extremities showed swelling in the right knee with bilateral pronounced effusion in both knees. Palpation revealed extreme generalized tenderness in the right knee more pronounced than the left. Mobility of the right knee showed a reduced range of motion (ROM) with a lack of 70 degrees on flexion and 25 degrees on extension, inducing pain with further movement. The left knee showed neither active nor passive limitations. Muscle weakness was noted bilaterally, however, power was 5/5 bilaterally on flexion and extension. No sensory or reflex alterations were found. No joint stability (ligament) issues were observed in either knee. Upper and lower joints were in normal limits.\nBased on the underlying SLE, the sustained corticosteroid therapy and the clinical presentation, the patient was suspected to have developed secondary ON in both knees. The diagnosis was confirmed by MRI, which showed extensive subchondral fluid on both lateral femoral condyles and anterior weight-bearing surfaces of the medial femoral condyles, more pronounced in the right knee. These findings were associated with impending collapse and fragmentation of the articular surface. Therefore, extensive ON involving bilateral medial and lateral femoral condyles was confirmed and staged as Ficat IV. Furthermore, areas of bone infarction in the distal femoral diaphysis and proximal tibial diaphysis were also observed, with no evidence of ON concerning the subarticular proximal tibia. Based on an initial clinical assessment, the right knee was confirmed as more advanced ON than the left ().\nBone marrow (BM) was aspirated five times (initial three times for the right knee injection and two final for the left knee injections), with intervals of 1–2 weeks and alternating the harvesting site. Under sterile conditions, the BM aspiration site (Posterior Superior Iliac Spine—PSIS) was marked upon visualization with ultrasound guidance, followed by injection of 2% lidocaine in the soft tissue and periosteum (). The BM tissue was collected using a 14G trocar needle, with an entry point created with the introducer needle and the bone drilled through the periosteum and cortex into the spongy bone into a depth of 4 cm. Subsequently, BM was aspirated slowly at a rate of 1–2 cc per level and withdrawn gradually using heparinized syringes. The aspirated BM (i.e., BMA) was then passed through a customized size-based cell filtration system (Chondrostem device, manufactured by CCRT, Toronto, Canada. Patent pending) similar to other concentrators (Ito et al., ; Otsuru et al., ) to enrich the mononuclear cells (MNCs) fraction, especially the mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) component present within that fraction and described as the culture-expanded progeny of in vivo connective tissue progenitors (CTP) (Sivasubramaniyan et al., ).\nThe injections were performed under local anesthesia, sterile conditions and ultrasound guidance, using a 18-gauge 3.5-inch needle inserted 2 cm deep into the condyle bone (). The processed BMAC was injected in five sessions for right and left knees independent treatments (), including two intra-articular injections only to the right knee given its early signs of articular cartilage involvement.\nin vitro data showed that Chondrostem filtration result in CD45−CD44+CD90+CD105+ MSC/EPC subpopulation enrichment (43% of total) (). MSC-related phenotypic profile and tri-potentiality (bone-fat-cartilage) was established in BMAC cells cultured for two passages in vitro ().\nThe patient was followed-up 1 week after each procedure at the same time with the following injection, then at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months while undergoing post-surgical rehabilitation. At each visit joint effusions, swelling and tenderness to palpation at the joint line level, and range of motion (ROM) were assessed. Patient-reported outcomes measurement (PROM) were assessed using clinically validated scoring systems (VAS, KOOS, and WOMAC).\nFour weeks after the final procedure pain was almost absent on both sides (1–2/10), with weight-bearing the left leg (not the right one) and able to walk with crutches. On examination, there was only mild effusion on the left knee with a full ROM, whereas the right side had limited 10 degrees on extension and 35 degrees on flexion. At 6 months, the patient was pain-free (0/10 on the left and 1/10 on the right side) with a full ROM on both sides. She was able to bear weight, walk and even dance without the support of crutches. Her improvement continued until 9 and 12 months, when she was pain-free with full ROM and with the ability to run (). Clinically, the PROM showed significant improvement over time, starting right after the end of the sequential therapy one (1) month after its start and for a 24-months follow-up (). MRI at 12 months showed bone maturation (with granulation tissue) in active ON areas, less marked BM edema bilaterally and significant reduction in subchondral fluid, which proved radiological improvement supporting the positive clinical progression. With exception of the lateral condyle of the right knee, which showed persistent irregularities and fragmentation/collapse of the central and posterior weight bearing surfaces, the rest of structures did not show signs of collapse or fragmentation (). At 24 months follow-up the patient was stable in terms of pain and function, able to cycle and dance, no effusion in the knees with full active and passive range of motion on physical examination.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MARK WIlLIAMs,18,F,A+,Obesity,02-11-2019,Jay Hicks,and Oliver Sons,Aetna,21144.67945,153,Urgent,09-11-2019,Lipitor,Inconclusive,"An 18-year-old African American female with no previous medical history presented with seizure-like activity in the upper extremities at a local emergency department. After a negative head computed tomography (CT) scan and treatment with antiepileptic drugs, she was discharged from the hospital. Over the next several days, she developed progressive mood changes with emotional lability, child-like behavior, confusion, and slow mentation and was admitted to our hospital. The remainder of her complete neurological examination was normal. The head CT was again negative and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast identified no structural lesions. During the next 3 days, behavioral issues progressed with agitation and aggressive behavior. Initial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies revealed elevated white blood cell count with lymphocytic predominance (WBC 21, lymphocytes 92%, RBC <1, protein 16, cells counted 100, glucose 81), and she was started on 1,000 mg methylprednisolone for 5 days ().\nOn days 3 and 4, the patient developed episodes of lip smacking and right hand tremors. Electroencephalograms revealed focal seizures arising from the left temporal lobe, and the patient was started on levetiracetam at up to 1,000 mg twice daily, but it was stopped due to the concern that it was contributing to her mental status issues. She was then put on fosphenytoin at 100 mg twice daily and lacosamide at 100 mg twice daily, but she continued to have left temporal focal seizures. Ultimately, she needed sedation due to agitation, requiring high doses of midazolam (30 mg/h) and propofol (100 mcg/kg/h), which stopped the seizures in addition to sedating her. On this regimen, she had breakthrough periods of attempting to get out of bed, sitting up, and near self-extubation; therefore, dexmedetomidine (max 2.0 mcg/kg/h) and fentanyl (max 200 mcg/h) were added. On day 6, neural autoantibody tested positive in serum for the NMDA receptor by cell-based assay, and in CSF (titer of 1:128), confirming the diagnosis of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. She was then started on a 5-day course of IVIg. At that time, the examination revealed a gaze-evoked nystagmus, ataxia, and dysmetria. Oncologic evaluation, including CT of the chest, the abdomen, and the pelvis with and without contrast, full body positron emission tomography (PET) scan, and vaginal ultrasound, were all negative for any visible solid-organ tumor such as ovarian teratoma or other underlying neoplasm.\nHer hospital course was complicated by increasing agitation, psychotic episodes, seizures (clinical and subclinical, including non-convulsive status epilepticus), dystonia, and autonomic instability with paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity, leading to subsequent intubation and management in the ICU on day 13.\nIn total, the patient received first-line therapy consisting of methylprednisolone (1,000 mg IV for 5 days), IVIg (two rounds of 2 g/kg over 5 days each), and PLEX (two rounds for 5 days), followed by rituximab at 375 mg/m2 administered weekly (). Given that PLEX can potentially negate the effects of rituximab, a second dose of rituximab was given after the completion of PLEX and following a discussion with hematology–oncology and neuroimmunology specialists who determined that a second round of rituximab was deemed clinically reasonable. Cyclophosphamide was considered but, given the potential gonadal toxicity and the patient's young age and future child-bearing potential, the mother requested an alternate immunotherapy. In consultation with various specialists including hematology and pharmacy and with preliminary reports of off-label bortezomib use for similar refractory cases (–), we opted to treat the patient with this drug.\nBortezomib was administered as four doses of 1.3 mg/m2 subcutaneously on hospital days 40, 43, 47, and 50. After the initiation of bortezomib, the patient showed a remarkable recovery with no drug tolerability issues, allowing weaning of sedation, and tracheostomy reversal on day 55 and subsequent transfer out of the ICU. She was discharged on hospital day 70 with oral prednisone taper and periodic outpatient IVIg infusions. She continued to show cognitive improvement at a follow-up appointment 5 weeks after discharge, with a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) of 20/30. At follow-up 3 months later, CSF anti-NMDA titer levels had fallen to 1:64 and she self-reported feeling normal. She had a MOCA of 26/30 and had started online college.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to her dates she was thought to be 12 weeks pregnant; no ultrasound had yet been performed.\nThe patient was hemodynamically stable, with no tachycardia or hypotension. The first examination was reassuring, as there was no bleeding, and a pelvic ultrasound showed an intrauterine pregnancy with an embryo measuring 72 mm, biometric indices were consistent with the menstrual age, and cardiac activity was visualized (Figure ). The patient was discharged, but she was reevaluated the next day for worsening pain with vomiting.\nA new pelvic ultrasound was performed that showed an embryo with cardiac activity, inside a uterine cavity but the myometrium looked fine. No intraperitoneal effusion was visualized. A unicorn uterus was visualized in the left, and pregnancy inside another cavity. No 3D ultrasound had been performed before, and the uterine malformation was not previously labeled.\nGiven that the patient’s pain progressed, a decision was made to perform a diagnostic laparoscopy immediately. Laparoscopy revealed rupture of a gravid rudimentary uterine horn in the right side, causing excessive intraperitoneal bleeding (Figure ).\nDue to an enlarging gravid uterus, it became necessary to perform a laparotomy. Excision of the right rudimentary horn and ipsilateral salpingectomy was performed with a LigaSureTM device. The entire cavity was removed with the right tube. Hemostasis was also provided by several separate points of a 0 braided suture on the area of communication with the remaining uterine horn. One liter of blood was aspirated from the abdominal cavity. Four units of blood were transfused intra- and postoperatively. Her post-op recovery was uneventful.

She was given intravenous (IV) fluids and discharged with the diagnosis of a viral illness. However, she returned to the ED the next day with continued abdominal pain and new symptoms of fevers, chills, decreased appetite, and dysuria. She was tachycardic with a heart rate (HR) of 112 beats per minute (BMP), respiratory rate (RR) of 22 breaths per minute (BRPM), oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 95% on 2 L of nasal cannula, and a max temperature of 103 °F. She had leukocytosis with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 17,400 cells per microliter, with 92.8% neutrophils, 3.6% lymphocytes, 2.0% monocytes, and 0.2% eosinophils. Procalcitonin was 0.25 ng/ml, LDH not reported, lactate and lipase were negative. Urine analysis showed positive only for moderate blood and a urine toxicology positive only for cannabinoids. Recent HIV and STD testing were negative. Chest X-Ray (CXR) showed bilateral reticulonodular opacities (Fig. ).\nThe patient was admitted and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat potential pneumonia (PNA). She tested negative for both influenza A and influenza B. Tests for C. Diff, HIV, p-ANCA, c-ANCA, and ANA were all negative. Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia psittaci, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella were also negative. Treatment was supportive with oxygen therapy, steroids, antibiotics, antiemetics, and pain medication. The patient was on steroids for a total of 6 days while hospitalized and then discharged on a prednisone taper. The patient reported an overall improvement in her symptoms upon discharge on day 6.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHArLeS pHIllIPs,18,F,A+,Arthritis,04-08-2023,Lauren Salas,Houston-Chan,Medicare,21830.56433,415,Emergency,09-08-2023,Penicillin,Inconclusive,"An 18-year-old female patient attended a clinic/school seeking to solve aesthetic and functional problems. After an initial evaluation, several dental losses and the presence of some deciduous teeth were observed, revealing a multiple agenesis condition. Clinical examination and CT scans were performed. In the mandible, the patient presented all the deciduous teeth, and only permanent teeth present were #36 and #46 ().\nAnalyzing the mandible CT scan, it was observed a sizeable horizontal deficiency of the alveolar ridge in the crestal symphysis region. This situation made impossible the placement of implants in the ideal three-dimensional position, requiring previous bone reconstruction ().\nIt was decided to perform horizontal bone augmentation by guided bone regeneration with only a bovine bone substitute (Bio-Oss® Geistlich), because it presents reproducible results with acceptable success rates and low rate of complications, besides providing lower morbidity for the patient. The marginal gingiva was healthy and presented a good width of keratinized tissue. Amoxicillin 500 mg 1 every 8 hours for 7 days and 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate rinse 3 times a day for 14 days were prescribed, initiating 2 days before surgery. Infiltration anesthesia was performed with 4% articaine anesthetic in the mental nerve plexus, bilaterally. The incision was intrasulcular in the region from 75 to 85, with small vertical releases at the distal of this incision. A mucoperiosteal flap was raised. At the recipient site, soft tissue debridement and small perforations with 1.3 drills were performed in the cortical bone with the purpose of providing irrigation and blood supply to the bone substitute. At this moment, 1.0 cc of bone substitute (Bio-Oss® Geistlich, large granules) was prepared to be placed at the recipient site and covered with double layer collagen resorbable membrane (Bio-Gide® Geistlich, 25 mm × 25 mm). Both bone substitute and collagen membrane were displaced on different recipients, with saline for 10 minutes of hydration prior use. The buccal flap was repositioned, covering all the membrane and avoiding displacement. The suture was performed with simple interrupted and sling sutures using the deciduous teeth as support, with silk 4.0 (Ethicon). After the surgical procedure, a bandage (Micropore®) was performed to compress the surgical area to diminish possible edema ().\nNimesulide 100 mg twice a day for 3 days, paracetamol 750 mg 3 times a day (if necessary for pain control), and continuation of the preoperative antibiotic and antiseptic mouthwash protocols were prescribed. The patient was instructed to eat only soft foods, put ice bags on the surgical area for 48 hours, and avoid exercises for 7 days. The sutures were removed after 7 days.\nAfter 12 months, the area of the horizontal bone augmentation was clinically evaluated and through cone-beam CT. After the analysis of the tomography radiograph and initial and final prototypes, the gain in bone thickness was approximately 5 mm. Clinically, the success of the procedure was confirmed, as well as the presence of good health of the gingival tissue (Figures and ).\nThe surgery to install 6 dental implants (Ankylos®, Dentsply) was performed 12 months following the horizontal bone augmentation, according to the reverse planning and surgical guide, between the region of #34 and #44. All implants presented initial stability above 35 N/cm. The deciduous teeth 74, 73, 72, 71, 81, 82, 83, and 84 were removed at this time. After detachment of the mucoperiosteal flap, we found new bone tissue with excellent quality with the native bone appearance and without the presence of loose particles of a bone substitute and surrounded by fibrous tissue. At this moment, a bone fragment of approximately 3 mm was removed using a 2.0 mm trephine drill in a buccolingual direction for histological analysis of the grafted area ().\nIn the histological analysis, it was observed the formation of cortical bone with the presence of osteocytes found in several sizes and homogeneously distributed. Bone substitute particles were present in a graft/cortical bone interface. However, it could be confirmed on the clinical observation that the regenerated bone was similar to the natural bone ().\nImmediately after implant surgery, standard prosthetic abutments (A4) were installed (Ankylos®). After suturing, with 5.0 polypropylene (Atramat), because of its fewer biofilm accumulation, the impression-taking of the abutments and occlusal registration were accomplished. A temporary acrylic resin fixed prosthesis was installed immediately to the surgical procedure, within 24 hours (). Pre- and postoperative recommendations and medication protocols were identic to the first surgery, but without the need for bandages.\nFour years after bone augmentation of the alveolar ridge, a tomographic examination was requested to evaluate the bone tissue, as well as the implants, where bone normality and stability around the implants were seen, to confirm our clinical evaluation (Figures and ).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the anamnesis, the patient reported having had a bicycle fall within three months. A clinical examination revealed a scar on the right upper lip (Fig. A) and the absence of teeth 31 and 41, avulsed as a result of the fall (Fig. B).\nTooth 11 was found to be out of the occlusal plane (Fig. B), with grade 2 mobility and marked painful response to vertical percussion. Pulp sensitivity tests with thermal stimulation (cold) using Endo-Ice® (Maquira Dental, Maringá, Paraná, Brazil) and an electrical test with Pulp-Tester® device (Odous De Deus, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil) were negative. A periapical radiographic examination revealed a radiolucent imaging in the apical segment of the root, compatible with a root fracture (Fig. C).\nIn order to support correct treatment planning, a CBTC was requested. CT scans were performed (I-Cat®, Imaging Sciences International, Hatfield, Pensilvânia, EUA), operating at 120KV, 36.12mAs, exposure time of 40 s, 0,2mm voxel size and Field of view (FOV) of 6x6 cm.\nThe images were analyzed, and coronal and sagittal sections confirmed the separation of several fragments along the entire transverse root extension, as well as the absence of root resorption resulting from the fracture (Fig. A,B).\nAfter the patient’s free and informed consent, a coronary access was performed under absolute isolation by means of dental floss ties and a Top Dam® gingival barrier seal (FGM, Joinville, SC). The working length was precisely determined by the CBTC, at 17 mm, with the palatal face of the tooth as the apical end the (Fig. A). Mechanized instrumentation was performed using the Protaper Next system up to the X5 file (Dentsply Tulsa Dental Specialties, Tulsa, OK, USA). Copious irrigation with 5.25% sodium hypochlorite was performed and during each instrument exchange using a 5 mL Luer syringe equipped with NaviTip 30 gauge needles (Ultradent Products Inc., Indaiatuba, SP), inserted into the canal up to 2 mm from the WL. After complete instrumentation, the canal was irrigated with 5 mL of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, Formula and Action) at 17% followed by application of an intracanal calcium hydroxide medication (Ultracal, Ultradent, South Jordan, UT) for 10 days (Fig. A). After the placement of a delay dressing, a slight wear was made on the incisal edge of the tooth.\nWhen no signs and symptoms were observed, a 4 mm apical plug was created using Bio C repair Bioceramic cement (Angelus, Londrina, Paraná), with the aid of condensers (Odous De Deus, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil). Subsequently, the two coronary millimeters were filled with thermoplastic gutta percha, inserted with an Obtura pistol (Sybron Endo, Orange, CA, USA) (Fig. B).\nTwo years later, a clinical and radiographic examination was performed and no signs or symptoms of therapy failure were observed (Fig. C). A new tomographic examination was requested to follow up on the apical fragment without endodontic treatment. Mineralized tissue interposition was observed in the fracture region, without any resorptive alterations. Periapical region integrity was maintained, with no periradicular lesion or ligament thickening (Fig. C).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An abdominal CT scan showed a 60-mm mass confined to the upper pole of the spleen; therefore, she was referred to our department for surgical treatment (Fig. a, b). The tumor showed higher intensity on T1-weighted MRI and lower intensity on T2 imaging than the normal spleen. In dynamic MRI, the contrast was gradually enhanced from the edge toward the inside, with a spoke-wheel pattern, without malignant findings (Fig. c). From such findings, the tumor was suspected to be splenic lymphangioma. It was a benign tumor, but we decided to resect it because of her symptoms. We performed laparoscopic partial splenectomy on the patient with the plan to divide the upper pole branch of the splenic artery and remove only the upper spleen (Fig. d). The patient underwent surgery under general anesthesia in the lithotomy position by a co-axial approach using four ports and a liver retractor (Fig. ). After peeling the tissue around the pancreatic tail and spleen hilum, the upper pole branch of the splenic vessels was clamped (Fig. a). The ischemic side of the tumor was confirmed, and the upper pole branch of the splenic vessels was divided as planned (Fig. b). Using a bipolar electrocoagulation hemostasis device and a vessel sealing system, the spleen was dissected at the ischemic parenchyma approximately 1 cm from the demarcation line. Because the ischemic-side spleen was dissected, there was less bleeding (Fig. c). The excised spleen was retrieved from the umbilical wound and extended several centimeters using a retrieval bag without crushing the specimen. The operation time was 217 min, and bleeding was minimal. The patient was discharged after 8 days without complications. The patient’s symptoms disappeared with no recurrence at 1 year postoperatively. Blood tests and CT scans confirmed no problems with the remaining spleen (Fig. d). The specimen showed a well-defined mass of 60 × 48 mm (Fig. a). Histologically, vascular-like structures were growing, and in the lumen, lightly acidic serous substances and histiocytic cells were stored (Fig. b). Immunohistochemical staining yielded D2-40 weakly positive (Fig. c), CD31-positive, CD34-negative, and CD8-negative results (data not shown); hence, a cavernous type lymphangioma was diagnosed. Ethics committee approval was unnecessary for our case report, and the patient gave informed consent; anonymity was preserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She had, until recently, required haemodialysis via a tunnelled permanent vascular access catheter which was still in situ. Complicating her immunosuppression, Cryptococcus neoformans meningitis was diagnosed through lumbar puncture seven months earlier. She was initially treated with intravenous amphotericin and flucytosine and was subsequently placed on therapeutic oral fluconazole.\nOutpatient transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a large echogenic mass in the right atrium at the tip of the vascular access catheter. Transoesophageal echocardiography confirmed an echogenic mass in the right atrium measuring 23 mm × 26 mm (see ) and a patent foramen ovale (PFO) with left to right shunt (see Clip ). The differential diagnoses considered were that of atrial thrombus complicating vascular access, as well as an infective focus. A primary tumour was unlikely given a normal transthoracic echocardiogram four months before.\nInflammatory markers and septic screening with blood cultures were performed. C-reactive protein was 0.9 mg/L, and the neutrophil count was 9.5 × 109. Three blood cultures were negative for bloodstream infection. Ventilation perfusion scanning revealed segmental pulmonary emboli. After multidisciplinary discussion, standard percutaneous catheter removal was deemed high risk due to potential embolisation. Anticoagulation with Apixaban was initiated for suspected atrial thrombus, and serial cardiac imaging was organised. Removal of the vascular access catheter was to be planned after thrombus resolution, and the patient was discharged [].\nFour weeks later, she represented with lethargy and fevers to 39.4 degrees Celsius. Inflammatory markers were elevated with a C-reactive protein of 157 mg/L and neutrophils of 10.2 × 109. A repeat infective panel was performed, and empiric therapy with intravenous gentamicin and vancomycin was provided due to skin colonisation with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Blood cultures, including vascular catheter cultures, were positive for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and a diagnosis of line-associated bacteraemia was made. Infectious diseases input was sought, and broad-spectrum antimicrobials with intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and cefepime were administered. Regular therapeutic oral fluconazole was continued. Rapid clinical response to antimicrobial therapy was seen with defervescence within 24 hours.\nRepeat transthoracic echocardiogram showed no interval change in the right atrial mass despite anticoagulation. This placed the diagnosis of thrombus in doubt, and in the setting of bacteraemia, complicating infection could not be excluded. After multidisciplinary review by infectious diseases, cardiology, cardiothoracic surgery, nephrology, and interventional radiology, definitive management of the atrial mass was deemed appropriate. This decision was made considering the diagnosis of thrombus was in doubt after anticoagulation failed to reduce its size, and in the setting of bacteraemia, complicating infection could not be excluded. Endovascular removal and thrombolysis were deemed high risk due to potential for embolisation. The decision was made to pursue open surgical thrombectomy, PFO closure, and vascular catheter removal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was negative for ischaemic stroke prior to on-pump cardiothoracic surgery.\nSurgery was performed (see ) with no postoperative complications, and she was discharged seven days later. Histology demonstrated organised thrombus with no evidence of abscess, granuloma, endocarditis, or myxoma (see ).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Drew MadDeN,18,F,AB+,Obesity,05-10-2019,William Hunt,"Francis and Smith Pope,",Aetna,5526.865493,358,Emergency,07-10-2019,Aspirin,Abnormal,"An 18-year-old African American woman with no psychiatric history was brought to the ED by her parents due to an overnight change in behavior. They reported that she had been awake all night, acting paranoid and telling them she was seeing God. On interview she was tangential, disorganized, and appeared psychotic. She spoke primarily in the third person, with no insight into the circumstances that led to her ED presentation. Multiple family members denied any observed prodromal symptoms, only reporting that she was experiencing frequent intermittent headaches over the preceding month.\nThere was low suspicion by her family and boyfriend for any recent drug use. Brain MRI and laboratory studies (complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, thyroid stimulating hormone, urine drug screen) were unremarkable. Her vitals were significant for tachycardia in the 100-130 beats per minute range. Family reported a history of schizophrenia in the patient’s maternal grandmother, but given the somewhat atypical presentation and the mother’s history of autoimmune disease, specifically systemic lupus erythematous, additional workup was performed for autoimmune encephalitis. Key portions of this workup would not result until approximately two weeks later.\nThe patient was admitted to psychiatry and initially started on risperidone with intramuscular (IM) haloperidol as needed for agitation. On the third day of admission, she developed symptoms consistent with retarded type catatonia: withdrawn, mutism, negativism, echolalia, staring, posturing, positive grasp reflex, and stereotypy. Her Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) score was 21 []. That same day her symptoms were further complicated by a brief dystonic reaction in her neck and lower extremity. Risperidone was discontinued and a lorazepam challenge provided moderate improvement of the catatonic symptoms with complete resolution of the dystonia. Her symptoms continued to improve for the remainder of the day (BFCRS decreased to six) until the next day when she began exhibiting symptoms more consistent with excited type catatonia (stereotypy, agitation, combativeness, impulsivity). Tachycardia and intermittent urinary incontinence were present as well.\nAgitation during this period was managed primarily with lorazepam (averaging 10 mg total daily) due to the ongoing catatonia, the previous dystonic reaction, and as a precaution for neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) after a rise in creatine kinase (CK) to around 1,000 U/L. She did not develop a fever or rigidity, but was transferred to medicine for three days to receive IV fluids due to poor oral intake and a further rise of her CK to approximately 3,000 U/L. This was ultimately attributed to intramuscular (IM) injections and restraint use. Following resolution of the rhabdomyolysis, she was started on olanzapine 10 mg twice daily after lorazepam monotherapy failed to provide adequate symptom improvement over the previous week. Most significant was her persistent distress and agitation: striking out and hitting staff, looking scared, walking backward periodically throughout the unit, all while remaining unable to share her internal experiences.\nThe full serum autoimmune encephalitis panel obtained 15 days prior returned mildly elevated for voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC) and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65). These results combined with her overall clinical picture prompted further workup by neurology (Table ). CT of the thorax was performed and showed two small ground glass opacities that indicated possible foci of infection, inflammation, or mild atelectasis (Figure ,B). However, CT of the abdomen and pelvis was significant because an adnexal lesion was present; that lesion was further investigated with ultrasound, which showed a 3.8 cm left adnexal cystic lesion with posterior mural nodule (Figure ,B). MRI of the pelvis was then suggested for further workup, and showed an ovarian mass deemed most likely to be a hemorrhagic cyst, but follow-up imaging was recommended in four to six weeks to rule out an ovarian neoplasm (Figure ,B). Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed excess diffuse beta activity attributed to lorazepam use. A lumbar puncture was obtained by interventional radiology, with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showing no significant signs of infection or inflammation. CSF antibody testing was sent to an outside laboratory and would result about one month later.\nOnce on the lorazepam and olanzapine together, her agitation gradually improved over the course of a week. When interviewed, she had no memory of the previous weeks in the hospital and denied prodromal symptoms or recent drug use. She was able to participate in psychological and cognitive assessments during the final three days of her hospitalization. The Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI), Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory - second edition (MMPI-2), and Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) selective cards (cards one, two, three, and five) were administered [-]. Results showed an Intelligent Quotient (IQ) of 67-69, with her overall cognitive assessment appearing inconsistent with the patient’s baseline cognitive functioning. Her MMPI-2 profile was noninterpretable due to an inconsistent pattern of responses, and her responses to TAT cards were impoverished in terms of content. The psychologists concluded that the results of the assessment were consistent with a psychosis that had not fully resolved.\nAttempts to decrease her medications prior to discharge caused swift decompositions in behavior. She was discharged on lorazepam 1 mg three times daily and olanzapine 10 mg twice daily at the request of the patient and her family, who felt she had returned to her baseline functioning. CSF testing resulting after discharge was positive for anti-NMDA receptor antibodies. Neurology saw her for follow-up six weeks later and she was reportedly doing well. She had returned to work and was off the medications because they made her tired. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) screening showed some mild deficits (26/30) in visuospatial function, word recall, and verbal fluency []. She was referred to gynecology for their opinion regarding the pelvic mass, and repeat ultrasound four months later was consistent with a simple cyst. The patient did not follow-up with her outpatient psychiatry appointment. However, two years later the patient was contacted and reported complete resolution of symptoms with no return of psychotic features.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pain was localized to the lower abdomen and groin, was exacerbated by urination and movement, and was alleviated only by high water intake. The patient also reported bright red blood in her urine, urinary frequency, and dysuria during this time. The patient had no prior history of similar symptoms. Family history was negative for any renal or bladder conditions or autoimmune disease. The patient was not sexually active and had never been sexually active in the past. She denied any symptoms of vaginal pain. Her only medication was a combined oral contraceptive pill (TriNessa: norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol), which she had started taking two weeks prior to symptom onset. Evaluation by ED staff included appropriate laboratory studies and a physical examination, including pelvic examination. Urinalysis showed microscopic hematuria, but other routine laboratory results were within normal ranges. She was discharged from the ED with a diagnosis of acute urinary tract infection (UTI) and a 10-day course of ciprofloxacin, with instructions to follow-up with her primary care clinician. Per patient, her symptoms did not improve following treatment with antibiotics. Since discharge, she reported urinating 60+ times per day with pelvic pain and an incomplete voiding sensation. Her intermittent pelvic pain progressively developed into constant pain over the next few months.\nShe subsequently visited various physicians within the specialties of family and internal medicine and urology for second opinions regarding the etiology of her symptoms, many who had different diagnoses and treatment plans. These included: UTI managed with nitrofurantoin, nephrolithiasis managed with phenazopyridine for pain management, and fungal vaginitis managed with nystatin cream. She experienced no symptomatic improvement with any of these treatments.\nApproximately one year after the symptom onset, she was referred to our obstetrics and gynecology clinic. An abdominal and pelvic CT scan was ordered but showed no abnormalities (Figure ). Outpatient cystoscopy was attempted but immediately terminated due to extreme pain. Even without cystoscopy imaging, the patient’s normal anatomy along with her symptomatology led to a diagnosis of chronic IC. She was advised to avoid triggers, encouraged to continue high fluid intake, and prescribed a higher dose of phenazopyridine for bladder relaxation and pain relief.\nThrough independent online searching and article browsing, the patient learned of a possible link between IC and OCPs and decided to discontinue her OCP. Following this change, the patient reported a drastic improvement in symptoms. Within four months of OCP discontinuation, she experienced an almost-complete resolution of her consistent pain, with only two subsequent flare-ups of pelvic pain and urinary frequency. Within seven months, she reported full resolution of all symptoms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient described a left-sided chest pain as not radiating, constant and stabbing in nature, moderate to severe, pleuritic, and not related to physical activity. The pain was associated with worsening shortness of breath and palpitations. The patient reported associated exertional dyspnea, dizziness, and fatigue that restricted her ability to take care of her baby. She denied fever, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or lower limb swelling. The patient had recently returned from a twenty-eight-hour car journey. Apart from anemia, her pregnancy and delivery were both uneventful. The patient has no allergies, no family history of cardiovascular, or clotting disorders.\nOn examination, the patient was distressed, tachycardic, and tachypneic and had normal blood pressure. She required FiO2 of 44% to maintain normal saturation. Heartbeat was regular: soft heart sounds without murmurs, gallops, or rubs. There was no parasternal heave and no clinical signs of fluid overload. Moreover, there were no clinical features of endocarditis. She had normal vesicular breath sounds bilateral, with no crackles or wheezes. Lower limb examination was normal without signs of deep vein thrombosis.\nHer EKG showed sinus tachycardia with T wave inversion in leads V1-3 ().\nBiochemical investigations showed a D-dimer of 3331 ng/ml (<500 ng/ml), BNP of 1034 pg/ml (<125 pg/ml), mildly elevated troponin I, and microcytic anemia. Otherwise, renal function, electrolytes, liver function tests, and thyroid hormones were within normal limits. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a severely dilated right ventricle with globally reduced right ventricular systolic function and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45-50% (). CT pulmonary angiogram showed a dilated pulmonary trunk with no evidence of pulmonary embolism (). An extensive venous thromboembolic workup including ultrasound Doppler of both lower limbs, CT venogram of the pelvis and lower limbs, and V/Q scan was negative.\nCardiac MRI showed a severely dilated right ventricle with a strain pattern with significant global reduced right ventricular systolic function, no signs of dysplasia or myocarditis, normal coronary anatomy, and no septal defects. Coronary angiography showed no coronary artery disease or dissection. Right heart catheterization (RHC) revealed the following: right atrial pressure = 12 mmHg (normal range 1-8 mmHg), right systolic ventricular pressure = 45 mmHg (normal range 15-30 mmHg), mean pulmonary artery pressure = 31 mmHg (normal range 10-22), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure = 7 mmHg (normal range 6-15), cardiac output = 2.97 L/min (normal range00204-8 mmHg), and cardiac index of 1.74/min/m2 (normal range 2.8-4.2), respectively.\nEventually, the patient was diagnosed with postpartum pulmonary hypertension. She was admitted and treated in the intensive care unit under the direct care of a pulmonary hypertension team. Her management was guided by a close follow-up of her hemodynamics. Given the high risk of sudden deterioration at any given point, inotropic support was considered and planned. Luckily, the patient's blood pressure remained normal. Good perfusion pressure was supported by normal lactate measures and absence of end-organ damage. Intravenous furosemide infusion was initiated with close monitoring of volume status, which was well tolerated without the need for inotropic support along with parenteral iron.

Since the age of 14 the complete blood count showed mild anaemia, without eosinophilia, which was treated with oral iron therapy. In 2014, at the age of 15, hypereosinophilia was detected for the first time, with an eosinophil count ranging between 1000 and 1600 cell/mm3 in the following years and with no other symptoms associated. In our clinic she underwent further investigations. The examinations showed a normal immunophenotype, negative autoimmunity tests, negative serology for Trichinella spp. with Western Blot technique (performed at the Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Rome, Italy). Serology for Echinococcus spp. (indirect haemoagglutination Cellognost Echinococcosis IHA, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Marburg, Germany) and Schistosoma spp. (Schisto II Western Blot IgG, LD-BIO Diagnostics, Lyon France) were both negative. Surprisingly, a borderline result for Strongyloides IgG ELISA (Bordier Affinity Products SA, Crissier, Switzerland) was obtained (index 1, reference values ≤0.9 negative, 0.9–1.1 borderline, ≥1.1 positive) and the diagnosis of strongyloidiasis was confirmed through detection of the rhabdoid larvae with a prominent genital primordium and adult male in agar plate stool culture (). Serology for S. stercoralis with SeroELISA Strongyloides IgG (IVD Research Carlsbad, Canada) was negative (index 0.41, reference value > 1 positive) as well as with the in house Indirect Immune Fluorescent Assay Test previously described by Boscolo et al. (title 0, reference value > 20) []. HIV 1–2 Ab/Ag and HTLV 1–2 Ab were negative. PCR for S. stercoralis on stool was performed in three different laboratories in Florence (amplification performed with RT-PCR homemade method), in Rome (PCR-based methods targeting the cox1 gene [] and Negrar (qPCR performed as described previously by Verweij et al. []) and the results were negative. The girl was treated with ivermectin 200 mcg/Kg/day for two days plus another two days of therapy two weeks apart. Blood samples performed after one, six and 12 months showed normal eosinophil count and negative serology for S. stercoralis (with the Bordier kit) and agar plate stool culture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gregory DelEOn,18,F,O+,Arthritis,18-04-2023,Brenda Wood,PLC Watson,Aetna,28305.20654,413,Elective,08-05-2023,Penicillin,Inconclusive,"This article describes the case of a SARS-CoV-2 infection in an 18-year old female Nigerian homozygous sickle cell disease (SCD) patient with the expression of a rare blood group phenotype. The patient is the first-born daughter of two sickle cell trait (SCT) carriers who have settled in Italy from Nigeria.\nOn March 6, 2020, the patient self-presented to the emergency department (ED) of the Arcispedale Santa Maria Nuova (ASMN) of Reggio Emilia for high grade fever (body temperature > 39°C) and headache persisting for the past 24 h.\nUpon physical examination, the patient had a body temperature of 37°C and normal oxygen saturation (SpO2 = 98%) in ambient air. Chest CT scan highlighted superior right lobe parenchymal thickening with minimal bronchial aerograms and three confined small areas (largest diameter < 26 mm) of ground glass opacities. No pleural effusion was detected.\nConsidering that by March 2020, the Italian health system was struggling with the implementation of a harmonized national public health strategy for the containment of the COVID-19 outbreak, testing for SARS-CoV-2 was not performed, and, given her mildly symptomatic status, the patient was discharged with Azithromycin 500 mg/day for 6 days and paracetamol for fever and pain relief. The patient was instructed about distancing measures from the rest of her family and home-quarantine.\nThe patient was previously known at the ASMN Hematology department for her homozygous SCD status with a blood group (BG) B Rh positive, and a rare phenotype characterized by: ccDee (Rh System); kk (Kell System); Fya-b- (Duffy system); Jka+b- (Kidd system); M+N-S-s- (MNS system); Cw- (Cw system); Le a-b- (Lewis system); Lu a-b+ (Lutheran system); Kp a-b- (Kp system). Patients of African descent with rare blood types may face difficulties when in need of chronic transfusions, because of scarcely available fully compatible blood products since certain antigens are very rare in the Caucasian population.[] If blood units are transfused within different ethnic backgrounds there is a higher risk of developing red blood cell (RBC) alloantibodies, which represents a severe complication for proper management of SCD patients.\nThe past medical history of our patient was notable for a SCD related episode of a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) in 2014 and left elbow joint effusion in 2017. In 2018, the patient suffered from acute intrahepatic cholestasis which resolved spontaneously, and since then, also in consideration of her rare BG, the patient was started on hydroxyurea (HU) prophylaxis (10 mg/kg/day for 5 days a week and 15 mg/kg/day on weekends). Past history for Acute Chest Syndrome (ACS) was negative.\nOn March 17th, the patient presented again to the ED for chest pain and was admitted to the short stay observation unit (SSOU) for 24 h. Electrocardiogram (EKG) was unremarkable and cardiac troponin dosing was negative. Pain management required i.v. antalgic therapy. Naso- and oro-pharyngeal swabs were obtained, and SARS-CoV-2 positivity was confirmed by real-time reverse-transcription–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR).\nLaboratory blood tests revealed mild anemia (hemoglobin (Hb) of 8.8 g/dL, hematocrit 27.5%, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 97 fl), and a platelet count of (PLT) 1217 × 1000/μL. White blood cell (WBC) count of 4.76 × 1000/μL with an absolute lymphocyte count of 1990/μL. Renal function and liver enzymes were within normal values, although LDH was not tested. Inflammatory profile revealed low C-reactive protein (0.27 mg/dL; normal range 0.00-0.50 mg/dL) and elevated D-dimer (1454 ng/mL; normal range 10-500 ng/mL).\nIn the absence of cough, fever, and respiratory distress (SoPO2 = 98%), ACS was likely excluded also in consideration that radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltrates was already evident much earlier (>48 h) than the onset of chest pain. HbS dosing was not performed because it is not among the routine emergency examinations. The patient was discharged with the advice to continue home self-isolation and clinical follow up was maintained through frequent phone calls. During the first phase of COVID-19 outbreak, mildly symptomatic patients were more preferably cared for at home, rather than admitted to overwhelmed hospitals.\nThe patient tested again positive for SARS-CoV-2 on two occasions (March 31 and April 18, 2020) and a follow-up chest CT scan (April 18, 2020) confirmed the persistence of a superior right lobe parenchymal consolidation.\nOn April 20, 2020 (47 days from symptoms’ onset), due to the enduring SARS-CoV-2 positivity along with radiological abnormalities at chest CT scan, the patient was admitted to the internal medicine department. The pulmonary consolidation was interpreted as a consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and subcutaneous heparin at therapeutic dose (4000 UI/sQ b.i.d.) was initiated [], along with IV ceftriaxone therapy (2 g). Urine legionella and pneumococcal antigen tests resulted negative. Normal plasma IL-6 levels (0.0-7.0 pg/mL), slightly increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) values (495 U/L; normal range 208-378 U/L), and normal C-reactive protein (0.19 mg/L) were reported. Oxygen therapy was not needed as the patient maintained SpO2 = 98% and pO2/FiO2 = 472 mm Hg at arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis in ambient air.\nOn day 3 of hospitalization, laboratory tests evidenced systemic hemolysis with a 1 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin in 48 h, and Hb-S fraction of 75.5%. Tramadol (100 mg/i.v./b.i.d.) was substituted with continuous intravenous morphine (30 mg/i.v.) for pain control and a single unit of packed red blood cell (PRBC) (O Rh negative, ccdee) was transfused to dilute the HbS level. No transfusion related adverse events were recorded and HbS decreased to 62.5%.\nOn day 4, the patient experienced worsening uncontrolled pain crisis (Numeric Rating Scale[] = 8) that required adjusting the intravenous morphine dose (40 mg/i.v./24 h) and HU therapy was increased to 20 mg/kg/day. On the same day, a first negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was obtained, although the second confirmatory test (on April 26th) turned out positive.\nOn day 5, due to a plummeting platelet count (<50 000/μL) heparin was suspended. To exclude heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), fondaparinux therapy was initiated and anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4)/heparin antibodies tested negative. The patient's vital signs remained unremarkable. Hb level increased to 9 g/dL, and no alterations in hepato-renal function and cardiac enzymes were evidenced, despite a persistently elevated D-dimer (1077 ng/mL).\nOn day 8, the patient's continuous i.v. morphine dose was increased (50 mg/i.v., continuous infusion) for uncontrolled pain.\nOn May 1, 2020, a second blood transfusion was attempted (O Rh positive, ccDee) but had to be interrupted due to transfusion related adverse events (dizziness and general malaise).\nOn day 13 from hospitalization, the patient referred a reduction in perceived pain (NRS = 5) and morphine was reduced (30 mg/i.v.). Further investigations with an extensive infectious panel was undertaken for the pulmonary consolidation and CMV-DNA, β-d-glucan, Parvo B19 IgM/IgG, QuantiFERON, all tested negative.\nOn May 6, 2020, after two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 swabs, the patient was discharged with a Hb of 9.5 g/dL, HbS of 61.9% (last measured on April 24, 2020), increased PLT count (792 000/μL), normal hepato-renal function, and controlled pain intensity (NRS < 5); in consideration of the patient's poor compliance with self-administration of subcutaneous heparin, she was started on 100 mg/day acetylsalicylic acid.\nOf the patient's five near family members, initially only the 52-years-old father, carrier of SCT, was diagnosed positive for COVID-19 with fever (38°C) and no cough or dyspnea. Chest X-ray and CT scan revealed findings suggestive of COVID-19-induced pneumonia. Oral hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) home treatment was prescribed at a dosage of 400 mg/b.i.d. for the first day and 200 mg/b.i.d. for the following 4 days. Sixteen days later, despite being asymptomatic since treatment onset, the patient still tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and achieved negativity only after 32 days from diagnosis. Eventually, also the 49-years-old mother, also carrier of SCT, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 but remained asymptomatic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
laUrA robinSON,18,F,A-,Hypertension,15-06-2020,Stephanie Farley,Romero LLC,Cigna,17391.21479,354,Urgent,25-06-2020,Lipitor,Abnormal,"An 18-year-old woman was transferred to the emergency department of our hospital because of loss of consciousness after an overdose of anti-hyperglycemic agents in a suicide attempt. She had been well until 11:00 pm 1 day before admission. Her grandmother found her unresponsive and lying on her belly at 6:00 am. Emergency medical service was called. She reportedly took her grandmother's pills: 64 tablets of metformin 250 mg (16,000 mg in total), 26 tablets of vildagliptin 50 mg (1,300 mg in total), 5 tablets of dapagliflozin-5 mg, 7 tablets of glimepiride-1 mg, 1 tablet of atorvastatin-10 mg, and some supplements (type and dose were unknown).\nShe had been attending a psychiatric clinic because of clinical depression and anorexia nervosa. She lived with her grandparents and was separated from her parents because she was sexually abused by her father. Approximately 5 months before admission, she tried to kill herself by jumping and was admitted to a psychiatric ward for 3 months. She reportedly did not intend to attempt suicide anymore at the time of discharge.\nOn arrival, she was unconscious and did not respond to pain stimuli. Her blood pressure was 94/56 mmHg and pulse was 70 beats/min. She had bradypnea with oxygen saturation at 100% while being on supplemental oxygen at 10 L/min via a reservoir mask. There was no rash or bruising on her skin. The remainder of the examination was normal. Her arterial blood gas showed lactic acidosis (pH 7.164, bicarbonate at 14.2 mmol/L, and lactate at 11.7 mmol/L) and hypoglycemia (glucose of 29 mg/dL). Blood creatinine level was elevated, and creatinine kinase level was normal. Other test results are shown in Table . The computed tomography performed on arrival was unremarkable except for slight infiltration of bilateral lower lung field, which is consistent with aspiration pneumonitis. The blood glucose level increased to 108 mg/dL after administration of 40 mL of 50% glucose. The trachea was intubated, and fluid resuscitation with 4 L of crystalloid was performed before starting norepinephrine. Supplementation with 40 mL of 8.4% bicarbonate was performed. Activated charcoal was administered via a nasogastric tube. Urgent hemodialysis was considered, and she was admitted to the ICU.\nAfter ICU admission, she developed recurrent hypotension despite aggressive fluid infusion and vasopressor support. Her blood pressure was becoming unstable with crystalloid infusion at 500 mL/h and stable with bolus infusion and albumin supplementation. For empirical antibiotics coverage, meropenem plus vancomycin was selected for possible septic shock. Hydrocortisone 200 mg was administered for possible relative adrenal insufficiency. The hemodynamic parameters obtained from Flotrac/Vigileo system (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) immediately before hemodialysis were as follows: cardiac output (CO) 2.1 (reference range; 4.0–8.0) L/min, cardiac index (CI) 2.7 (reference range; 2.5–4.0) L/min/m2, and stroke volume variation (SVV) 37% (reference range; 10%–15%) with the use of norepinephrine at 0.7 μg/kg of body weight/min and vasopressin at 0.02 U/min. The bedside ultrasound showed collapsed inferior vena cava. She received sustained low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) using a polysulfone membrane, with blood flow rate of 150 mL/min, and dialysate flow rate of 300 mL/min. Three hours after initiation of hemodialysis, she developed overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with platelet count of 27,000 cells/mm3, fibrinogen <35 mg/dL, prothrombin activity <10%, and d-dimer 31.3 μg/mL. Plasma exchange using 28 U of fresh frozen plasma frozen plasma was performed in tandem with SLED. After plasma exchange was completed, her hemodynamic status significantly improved: blood pressure 160/100 mmHg, pulse 120 beats/min, CO 9.0 L/min, CI 6.4 L/min/m2, and SVV 6% without using vasopressors. The antibiotics were discontinued after culture tests of the initial day were found to be all negative. The trends of plasma stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) as a marker of DPP-4 inhibitor's activity and soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) as a marker of endothelial injury measured after follow-up are shown in Figure .\nOn the following day, her creatinine kinase level increased to 41,560 U/L. Drug-induced rhabdomyolyses was suspected initially. However, her creatinine kinase increased up to 184,200 U/L on day 4 of admission. Her legs became stone-hard and were distended with massive edema. She also developed blisters on the arms. The details of intramuscular pressure of each limb are shown in Table . A diagnosis of acute limb compartment syndrome was made. Fluid overload was initially suspected as the cause of increased compartment pressure. Upper limb was observed to have fluid restriction and diuresis initially, and urgent decompressive fasciotomy of lower legs was performed (Fig. ). However, the next day, compartment pressure of right and left upper limb rose up to 79 and 61 mmHg, respectively (Table ). Decompressive fasciotomy of forearms was performed. The negative pressure wound therapy was introduced for management of massive edema and effusion. The wound was closed on day 31 with autologous skin transplantation. The operative wounds were cured at the time of hospital discharge (Fig. ).\nFollowing introduction of urgent hemodialysis, the patient developed rhabdomyolysis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) when she was away from hemodialysis transiently. She was getting oliguric, and therefore, hemodialysis was restarted on day 10. The trend of fluid balance after ICU admission is shown in Figure . The patient was extubated on day 21. Intermittent hemodialysis was discontinued on day 34. She was discharged from the ICU on day 37. She complained of muscle weakness and could barely move to the wheelchair without assistance at the time of ICU discharge, but her muscle strength improved with rehabilitation. She was finally able to walk by herself at the time of hospital discharge, but bilateral paralysis of common perineal nerves and Volkmann ischemic contractures remained. No recurrence of hypotension nor compartment syndrome occurred after ICU discharge. She was transferred to another hospital for further rehabilitation and mental care on day 109.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She presented with a throbbing, occipital headache, with associated photophobia and phonophobia. Her family reported multiple episodes of staring into space, repeated abnormal jaw movements, and urinary incontinence. She had one witnessed tonic-clonic seizure lasting three minutes, which spontaneously aborted and was followed by a postictal state for 15 minutes. She denied fever, chills, motor weakness, blurry vision, or any other symptoms. She had no sick contacts and recent travel, and did not take any medications including herbal supplements, but she did have unprotected sexual intercourse two weeks prior and took “morning-after pill” levonorgestrel. She denied alcohol and illicit drug use. The patient is a high school student who works part-time in a convenience store after school.\nPhysical examination showed an alert and oriented female with normal vital signs and in no acute distress, with cranial nerves intact, normal speech, normal motor, and sensation in all extremities, normal deep tendon reflexes, and no ataxia. There were bite marks and erythema noted in the right cheek mucosa; otherwise, the examination was normal.\nInitial work-up showed normal complete blood count, electrolytes, blood glucose, liver function, negative urine drug screen, normal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with/without contrast, and normal 30-minute electroencephalogram (EEG) with no seizure activity.\nTwo days into her hospital stay, she was noted to again have multiple staring episodes followed by confusion, as well as new behavioral symptoms with screaming, tearing, agitation, and difficulty with words finding. A continuous EEG was performed and found multiple seizures, arising from the left hemisphere and spreading to the right frontal region. These seizures lasted between 20 seconds to two minutes, and during seizure activity she was noted to have an elevation of her right arm, with facial grimacing or smiling, and at times left-sided head turn with unresponsiveness.\nLumbar puncture (LP) was performed, and CSF results are outlined in Table .\nA BioFire® FilmArray meningoencephalitis panel testing 14 common bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens by virtue of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on a CSF specimen returned negative for Neisseria meningitides, Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus agalactiae, Listeria monocytogenes, Haemophilus influenza, Escherichia coli, Cytomegalovirus, Enterovirus, Herpes simplex virus [HSV] I and II, Herpesvirus 6, Parechovirus, Varicella zoster virus, and Cryptococcus neoformans). Additional CSF testing included nonreactive venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) antibody test and West Nile virus IgM and IgG, and cultures for fluid, fungal, acid-fast bacilli were negative. No malignant cells were detected on cytology in the CSF specimen.\nGiven the initial negative LP with no infectious etiology, further evaluation was pursued with autoimmune studies and abdominal imaging due to suspicion of NMDA receptor encephalitis.\nAutoimmune work-up from CSF was negative for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) Ab, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPA-R) Ab, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) B receptor Ab, contactin-associated protein 2 (CASPR2) IgG, leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) IgG, amphiphysin Ab, anti-glial/neuronal nuclear Ab 1 (AGNA-1), and anti-neuronal nuclear Ab (ANNA) 1, ANNA-2, and ANNA-3.\nCSF was positive for anti-NMDA receptor 1 (anti-NR1) Abs at a titer of 1:32 (normal: <1:2), consistent with NMDA receptor encephalitis.\nFurther blood work-up revealed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 64 mm/hour (normal: 0-20 mm/hour) and C-reactive protein of 5.3 mg/dL (normal: <0.3 mg/dL); however, it was negative for antinuclear Ab, antineutrophil cytoplasmic Ab vasculitis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), syphilis, and West Nile IgG/IgM.\nWhile awaiting LP results, transabdominal pelvic ultrasound and pelvis MRI were obtained to look for underlying ovarian mass. Ultrasound results showed a solid lesion in the right ovary (Figure ).\nMRI results showed a complex 2.9 x 3.7 x 2.5 cm mixed solid and cystic mass in the right ovary, demonstrating septal and nodular enhancement suspicious for teratoma (Figure ).\nHer alpha-fetoprotein level was 7 ng/mL (normal: <6.1 ng/mL). The patient was started on levetiracetam and then subsequently switched to fosphenytoin and valproic acid due to worsened agitation while on the levetiracetam. This combination controlled her seizures for a few days, but seizures restarted with worsening agitation and the patient became less interactive and non-verbal compared with her admission day. Fosphenytoin was continued, but valproic acid was switched to lacosamide and quetiapine added.\nMethylprednisolone 80 mg intravenous every eight hours was started and was then increased to 500 mg every 12 hours for five days. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 30 g daily for five days was initiated while finalizing LP results due to high suspicion for autoimmune encephalitis. Lamotrigine was added due to increased agitation.\nThe patient underwent right ovarian resection, with pathology showing high-grade immature teratoma (grade 3). After the surgery, no more seizure activity was reported, and significant improvement in mentation was noted within one week. Lamotrigine and fosphenytoin were stopped. The patient had ongoing episodes of agitation while being hospitalized that responded to repeat IVIG treatments 30 g daily for four to five days; she received a total of 14 IVIG treatments over a period of six weeks.\nThe patient was started on chemotherapy with etoposide and cisplatin for her grade 3 immature teratoma (T1cN0M0). She was discharged on lacosamide, quetiapine, and prednisone taper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She was afebrile, but was experiencing abdominal pain, vomiting, muscle pain, headache and diarrhoea. She denied a history of known EVD exposure; thus, lacking either fever or EVD exposure, she did not meet the case definition despite having multiple other symptoms of EVD. She was transferred to the Princess Christian Maternity Hospital (PCMH)’s EVD isolation unit in Freetown for higher-level obstetrical care and because of a clinical suspicion of EVD despite not meeting the case definition. EBOV RT-PCR testing on admission was positive. At the hospital, she became febrile (39 °C) and delivered via spontaneous vaginal delivery, assisted by health-care providers in full PPE. She developed severe post-partum haemorrhage and hypovolemic shock, and died on the day of admission. The products of conception were not tested for EVD.\nThe healthy newborn was transferred to the Port Loko Observational Interim Care Centre (an observation Centre for asymptomatic children of EVD-infected parents or guardians).

ScOtT BROwn,18,F,B+,Asthma,17-08-2021,Lauren Salas,Franklin-Medina,Aetna,4958.849929,272,Elective,18-08-2021,Penicillin,Inconclusive,"An 18-year-old female with a history of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures presented to our Emergency Department (ED) as a Level II trauma activation following a high-speed MVA. Per emergency medicine service (EMS) personnel, the patient was an unrestrained driver traveling approximately 40 miles per hour when she lost control of the vehicle and hit a tree. The patient was hemodynamically stable and conscious on arrival. After obtaining a thorough history, it was determined that the patient was pregnant with a gestational age of 35 weeks and five days. Doppler ultrasound in the trauma bay confirmed that fetal heart sounds were normal.\nThe patient underwent a primary trauma survey by the trauma surgery team and was determined to be stable. On the secondary survey, the patient complained exclusively of left hip and right wrist pain. Obvious shortening of her left lower extremity was noted. She was otherwise found to be neurovascularly intact. The orthopedic service was immediately consulted. Radiographs were obtained demonstrating a left-sided, displaced transverse posterior wall acetabulum fracture with concomitant hip dislocation as well as a right-sided, volarly displaced distal radius and ulnar styloid fracture (Figures and ). The patient's wrist fracture was closed reduced and splinted. Reduction of the hip fracture-dislocation was attempted. The position of the hip was improved; however, a postreduction CT scan demonstrated residual dislocation due to instability imparted by a large posterior wall fracture fragment. The patient was placed into skeletal traction at this time.\nShortly after the patient's presentation, the Obstetrics/Gynecology (Ob/Gyn) service was consulted. The patient was evaluated, and the fetus was determined to be in no immediate danger; thus, there was no indication for immediate preterm delivery. Placental abruption was also ruled out with serial fibrinogen levels. The patient underwent extended 24-hour fetal monitoring and daily nonstress testing to continually assess for signs of fetal distress, of which there was none. After consultation between the Orthopedic and Ob/Gyn services, the final treatment plan was devised. The patient was administered with betamethasone for fetal lung maturity beginning on hospital day one. The patient subsequently underwent cesarean section on hospital day five without complication. Successively, the patient was taken for open reduction and internal fixation of her acetabulum fracture two days after delivery, and her wrist was subsequently operated on the following day. Throughout this time, the patient was maintained on enoxaparin for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis.\nThe patient's acetabulum fracture was fixed through a Kocher-Langenbeck approach, with the patient positioned prone on a radiolucent Jackson table. General anesthesia was utilized for the procedure, and prophylactic cefazolin was administered prior to incision. Once exposure was obtained, a Schanz pin was placed into the femur at the level of the lesser trochanter in order to distract the hip joint for irrigation and further removal of debris and clotted blood. The hip was reduced. All contused muscle was debrided, and the fracture edges were meticulously cleaned. Using bone reduction clamps and Kirschner wires, the fracture was anatomically reduced, and the fracture was spanned with two 3.5 mm pelvic reconstruction plates. Following fixation, an intraoperative CT scan and postoperative radiographs were obtained, confirming a near anatomic reduction.\nFollowing fixation of her acetabulum and wrist, the patient continued to be nonweight bearing to her left lower and right upper extremities. She was seen by physical therapy and recommended for rehab placement. She was deemed stable for discharge and transferred to rehab on hospital day 13. The patient was seen in follow-up at three weeks, three months, five months, and one year. She was to remain nonweight bearing for 10-12 weeks. Stable fixation was seen on radiographs at three weeks, with healing apparent at three months (). At five months, the patient was ambulating without a limp, and her exam was indistinguishable from that of her uninjured hip. At that time, arrangements were made for her to return to work and gym class. At one year, the patient re-presented for the management of a right lateral malleolus fracture sustained during an unrelated mechanical fall and subsequently underwent open reduction and internal fixation of this injury. Despite this, she continued to have no postoperative complications related to her acetabular fixation. Overall, she has recovered remarkably well without any hip-related complications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kIMbERlY Gray,18,F,O-,Cancer,07-04-2021,Jeffrey Clark,"Wright Weber, Harrison and",Blue Cross,24521.9965,380,Urgent,06-05-2021,Penicillin,Inconclusive,"An 18-year old female with a history of congenital hip dysplasia, irritable bowel syndrome treated with amitriptyline, and known prior post-operative PNES spells underwent an EGD and colonoscopy under general anesthesia, both induced and maintained with sevoflurane only. At the end of the procedure, she was successfully extubated after return of spontaneous ventilation and regaining consciousness. However, she subsequently displayed generalized shaking and unresponsiveness. During this episode, she had a retained pupillary response to light and no gross neurological deficits. Notably, the anesthesiologist was aware that she had a history of two prior PNES episodes after a hip hardware removal surgery and cholecystectomy surgery, after which EEG was unremarkable. Given this history, the surgery and anesthesia team decided to observe the patient in PACU instead of pursuing additional diagnostic workup. She did not experience any hemodynamic instability or respiratory abnormalities during this spell. After 45 minutes, her symptoms resolved and she was able to verbalize and follow commands. A psychiatry referral was placed and the patient was discharged the same day.

The patient also reported a persistent “pins and needles” sensation in her lower limbs. She showed no autonomic dysfunction or incontinence; however, her weight had increased by 7.5 kg. Her medical history was significant for N2O abuse with an average of 40 L/day during the last month. She had bought the N2O (compressed in a 40-L cylinder) from her friend to relax at home, and she inhaled the gas through a mask with a pipe connected to the cylinder. The patient had received hyperbaric oxygen therapy a week previously, which was not available in our hospital (She did not state her detailed therapeutic regimen).\nOur initial neurological examination revealed an anemic face with a normal mental status and cranial nerve function. Evaluation of muscle function and strength using the manual muscle test revealed that upper limbs reduced to grade 4+, whereas the proximal and distant lower limbs reduced to grade 4 and 0, respectively. Additionally, the muscular tension decreased without muscle fasciculation. Tendon reflex was absent bilaterally, and the plantar response was negative on both sides. The bilateral heel-knee-shin test was unstable; however, the bilateral finger-nose-finger test was stable. Sensory examination revealed that algesthesia and thermesthesia decreased symmetrically below the T4 level, whereas bilateral topesthesia, stereognosis, and vibration sensation were weakened.\nInitial laboratory tests revealed a decreased level of red blood cell count (2.81 × 1012 cells/L, reference range 3.8–5.1 × 1012 cells/L) and hemoglobin (93 g/L, reference range 115–150 g/L), normal MCV (99.3 fL, reference range 82–100 fL), elevated homocysteine (48.47 μmol/L, reference range 4.0–15.4 μmol/L), and normal vitamin B12 (180 pmol/L, reference range 150–652.54 pmol/L). Serum copper, zinc, and ceruloplasmin levels and thyroid function were within normal ranges. The patient tested negative for HIV antibody, STS, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and the autoimmune profile. The cerebrospinal fluid tests were normal with no evidence of albuminocytological dissociation.\nMRI of the spinal cord demonstrated segmental hyperintense lesion from level T3 to T6 in the posterior column (Figs. and ). MRI of the brain showed unremarkable findings. Electromyography revealed sensorimotor polyneuropathy, which was dominated by axonal injury and demyelination.\nBased on the abuse history, clinical manifestation, and auxillary examination, the patient was diagnosed with N2O -induced SCD and anemia. She was treated with cessation of N2O inhalation and smoke, additional methylcobalamin capsule (500 ug tid p.o.), compound vitamin B (one tablet tid p.o.), and rehabilitation therapy for 1 month. The symptoms of sensation and gait improved significantly. The patient refused to repeat electromyography and MRI post-discharge. She was reviewed incidentally at 9 months after discharge and was noted to be free of any disabling neurological symptoms.\nThe patients have provided their consent to publish the case report, and the consent procedure was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) and dexamethasone implant injections were applied 3 times to the right eye and 4 times to the left eye due to the suspicion of macular edema in different clinics. In the detailed anamnesis, the patient reported that she could see very well in childhood and did not use glasses and there was no history of trauma. There was a consanguineous marriage between mother and father (they were the children of each other's aunts).\nIn the ophthalmological examination, it was determined that the patient was orthophoric and eye movements were free in all directions. The patient had no refractive error. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was at the level of counting fingers from 2 meters in the right eye and 3 meters in the left eye. The cornea, anterior chamber, iris, and lens findings were within normal limits. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 12 mm in the right eye and 13 mmHg in the left eye.

The patient had experienced palpitation, external dyspnea and chest discomfort for a week before admission. She did not have recent history of trauma, immobilization and infectious disease. She did not have any known underlying disease and was not pregnant. She has never smoked, drunken alcohol, or taken oral contraceptive. She was alert but complained mild dizziness. Her neurologic examination showed normal findings. Her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 70/50 mmHg; pulse rate, 110 beats/minute; temperature, 36.5oC; respiratory rate, 34/min; and oxygen saturation, 94.3% in ambient conditions. Blood studies revealed the following: white blood cell count, 11,440/μL; hemoglobin, 14.4 g/dL; non-fasting glucose, 104 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 13.1 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.7 mg/dL; aspartate transaminase, 118 IU/L; and alanine transaminase, 88 IU/L. A thyroid function test indicated a state of thyrotoxicosis [T3 236.5 ng/dL (normal range, 80–200), free T4 28 pg/mL (8.9–17.9), thyroid-stimulating hormone, 0.08 mIU/L (0.17–4.05), thyrotropin binding inhibiting immunoglobulins (TBII), less than 0.3 (0 – 1 IU/L)].

Other immunological workup did not reveal any evidence of connective tissue disease or antiphospholipid syndrome. An electrocardiogram showed T wave inversions in the inferior and precordial leads (Fig. ). Chest computed tomography (CT) showed massive PTE in both central pulmonary arteries and diffuse goiter (Fig. a, b). However, there were no DVT in lower extremities, upper extremities and jugular veins. An echocardiogram showed severe pulmonary hypertension (right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) = 64 mmHg), and a dilated RV, right atrium and main pulmonary artery (Fig. a-c). Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with massive PTE, thyrotoxicosis, and partial protein S deficiency. To manage the PTE, we administered low molecular weight heparin for 5 days and added warfarin while adjusting the prothrombin time such that the internal normalized ratio was between 2.0 and 3.0. On the 7th day after admission, she was discharged with oral warfarin and methimazole. A follow-up echocardiogram obtained 3 months after anticoagulation therapy demonstrated normal dimensions and systolic function of the RV and disappearance of the D-shaped left ventricle (LV) (Fig. d-f). After thyrotoxicosis was treated with methimazole for a month, a euthyroid state was achieved and the goiter decreased to a normal size (Fig. ). The methimazole was gradually tapered off and stopped at 4 months. At a 6-month follow up visit, PTE and pulmonary hypertension had disappeared (Fig. c, d) but the patient still had a partial protein S deficiency.

She was brought to the hospital due to a sudden onset of distress. According to the accompanying family, she had been having episodes of disruptive behavior, impaired vegetative functioning and problems fulfilling activities of daily living. When she came out of prolonged sleep, she made irrelevant conversations and had episodes of incongruent crying. These episodes were followed by increased hyperactivity and agitation. She displayed tangentiality marked by exaggerated euphoria.\nDue to the perceived temporality of her distress, the family devised mechanisms within the household to protect her well-being until the erratic behavior had dissipated. The accompanying sibling informed the clinical team that DD appeared to suddenly become disturbed around the second week of the lunar month. The family recalled that her distress occurred almost every month in the last 2 years. On previous occasions, the family invited a traditional healer who ‘diagnosed’ her as being possessed by the jinn. The fact that she had had little insight into her altered state led the family to believe that her altered state of consciousness represented all the hallmarks of spirit possession. During psychiatric consultation, the clinical team noted that her distress receded and this coincided with the onset of menstrual flow. It appeared, therefore, that her symptoms had persisted until the onset of menstrual flow.\nDD was said to have met all her developmental milestones without difficulty. In Oman, individuals require 12 years to complete secondary education. She recalled that her menses began at 12 years old. She was deemed to have been very bright during her secondary school but upon reaching puberty, due to the aforementioned symptoms, she was only able to finish 9 years of formal education. Thereafter, as often is the case in Oman, she stayed within the confines of her extended and polygamous family. She has 5 siblings and no evidence of mental illness in the family.\nA routine urine drug screening was not significant, and neither were her hormonal study, brain CT scan, and EEG. Semi-structured interview, CIDI, did not confirm that she had the core features of manic (F30) and Bipolar affective disorder (F31), schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders (F20, F22, F23, or F25). Rather, DD was deemed to be marked with something akin to manic episode with psychotic symptoms - Manic episode, unspecified (F309)/brief psychotic disorder (F24). The results of her psychometric evaluation are shown in Fig. , conducted when DD was stable.\nHer disturbed behavior receded within 24 h of admission and she was discharged with antipsychotic olanzapine (5 mg) for which she was compliant. During the follow-up visit, she was stable and jovial and had already stopped her medication. The family and DD were given health education on how to adjust her life to accommodate for her predictable distress that occurred every month.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pain which was sudden in onset started four hours after a heavy evening meal. The pain was initially localized to the epigastrium. It had no known aggravating or relieving factors. The pain progressively worsened and became generalized the day after onset. It was associated with abdominal distension and absolute constipation. She was seen at a peripheral hospital and managed for a day with intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and subsequently referred for further management due to worsening of her condition. There was no history of fever, vomiting, had no history of peptic ulcer disease, and was not on NSAIDs or steroids. She had no history of alcohol use.\nOn examination, she was conscious and alert, not pale, anicteric, well hydrated, and had a temperature of 37.8°C. Her pulse rate was 110 beats per minute, regular, and good volume. Extremities were warm, and blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg. Heart sounds were normal with no murmurs.

Bowel sounds were absent. Digital rectal examination was unremarkable, and a pregnancy test was negative. Laboratory investigations revealed the following: Hb (11.0 g/dL), WBC (34.28 × 103/UL), and neutrophils (90.8%). Biochemical tests were all normal (). A diagnosis of generalized peritonitis 2° to hollow viscous perforation was made. The patient was resuscitated with intravenous fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and analgaesia. Nasogastric decompression as part of resuscitation yielded instantly two litres of brownish fluid with another 600 mL before surgical intervention. Informed consent was obtained from the patient and her parents and sent to the theatre for laparotomy.\nIntraoperatively, two litres of serosanguinous fluid was suctioned from the abdomen. About 300 mL of pus was suctioned from the pelvis. The stomach was grossly dilated and edematous with gangrene of the posterior wall about 18 × 12cm, 5 cm distal to the fundus. The vasculature of the stomach was intact. The rest of the gastrointestinal tract was normal. The gangrenous portion was resected, and repair was done in two layers using Conell and Lambert suture techniques (Figures and ). The partial gastrectomy specimen for histopathology looks gangrenous with patchy areas of fibrinoid exudates on gross sections which show dark brown appearance (). The abdomen was lavaged with warm saline and closed up. Postoperative recovery was uneventful.

The right eye was normal. The patient was a product of normal gestation and full-term delivery.\nThe patient underwent the following examinations: visual activity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, intraocular pressure (Goldmann), ophthalmoscopy, fundus photography (OCT TOPCON, 3D OCT-1 Maestro, Topcon, Tokyo, Japan) and Doppler ultrasonography. Intraocular lens (IOL) power was calculated using the Sanders-Retzlaff-Kraff (SRK) II formula. Snellen’s unaided distance visual acuity was 6/4 in the right eye and 6/60 in the left eye. There was no improvement with refraction. Hirschberg's test revealed a 3mm deviation of corneal reflex in the affected eye, which corresponds to an exotropia of 45 prism diopters. Anterior segments were normal; the lens in the left eye had a posterior capsular cataract measuring about 3mm in diameter. Examination of the anterior chamber angles with a four-mirror gonioscopy lens showed open angles up to the ciliary body (Shaffer grade-4) in all quadrants bilaterally. The ultrasound investigation revealed a thick hyperechoic linear band measuring 15.6mm in length from the retina to the posterior lens capsule that showed no flow in color. Doppler interrogation was also performed (Figure ). Fundus photography revealed normal findings in the right eye while the left eye revealed a PFV (Figures , ). Biometry showed the following values: keratometry K1-43.50D, K2-44.00D, an axial length of 23.6mm, and IOL power of 20.00D. She was worked up for small incision cataract surgery, excision of PFV, anterior vitrectomy, and insertion of a rigid polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) IOL into the sulcus. She was counseled on the prognosis after surgery and written consent was obtained.\nThe surgical procedure involved the following steps: cleaning of the periocular skin with 10% povidone-iodine, posterior sub-tenons anesthesia with xylocaine, instillation of 5% povidone-iodine around the forniceal conjunctiva, retraction of the lids with a flexible lid speculum, conjunctival peritomy on the superior aspect of the sclera, and wet field cauterization of bleeding conjunctival vessels. A chevron incision measuring 5mm at the base and 2mm from the corneal limbus was created with a crescent blade and the anterior chamber entered with a keratome knife. The depth of the anterior chamber was maintained with an ocular viscoelastic device when necessary. The anterior capsule of the lens was stained with trypan blue and a continuous circular capsulorrhexis was performed using a cystitome. The inner lip of the scleral tunnel was extended with the keratome knife to 7mm. Hydrodissection was performed with a hydrodissection cannula and the viscoelastic delivery of the nucleus was done. Cortical lens matter was aspirated using Simcoe irrigation-aspiration cannula and the anterior chamber depth was maintained. Posterior capsulotomy was performed around the Mittendorf dot and PFV was excised with intraocular scissors within the vitreous cavity, and anterior vitrectomy was performed through the scleral tunnel. A rigid PMMA posterior chamber IOL (PCIOL) was implanted into the sulcus (Figure ). Subconjunctival injection of dexamethasone and intracameral injection of moxifloxacin eye drops were done. The eye was cleaned with gauze and padded till the following day. Postoperative results were satisfactory with a day-one Snellen's visual acuity of 3/60, which improved to 6/60 one week post-op. Postoperative steroid and antibiotic eye drops were administered. The intraocular pressure was normal throughout the follow-up period. Over a year of the follow-up period, the visual acuity remained stable at 6/60 and 6/36, unaided and pinhole, respectively, and the intermittent exotropia resolved from 45 to 30 prism diopters. There was a relief of retinal traction and a resolution of leukocoria. Amblyopia therapy did not improve visual acuity for distance and near.

The patient was treated with one dose of intravenous naloxone (80 mcg) with the possibility of opioid sensitivity; there was no change in the patient’s respiratory effort. The patient became increasingly hypertensive and tachycardic as the sevoflurane wore off. The patient's preoperative labs were within normal limits. Because of this, it was suspected that the patient had a pseudocholinesterase deficiency. The patient was re-sedated with midazolam and propofol, transferred to the PACU for ventilator support. The patient was extubated four hours later after meeting the extubation criteria. A blood sample was drawn for the pseudocholinesterase levels from the patient which showed a serum level of 0.2 U/ml (normal - 1,800 - 6,600 U/L). The patient was observed for 24 hours, informed about the pseudocholinesterase deficiency, and discharged home the following day with no further complications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TeRRY wILlIamS,18,F,B+,Hypertension,23-09-2022,Juan Morse,Chen PLC,Aetna,42927.76573,288,Urgent,19-10-2022,Penicillin,Abnormal,"At 18 year old, a Caucasian female patient without any systemic diseases or drug use was presented for evaluation of gingival problems around her upper right premolar. Marginal periodontitis was diagnosed by her Dentist and the patient was referred to a Periodologist for root scaling. During the next two years, the patient was undergone perio-treatments under anti-inflammatory medications and had root canal treatment of her second premolar one year later. Biopsy of the lesion was not taken but the lesion was not gone but slowly progressed and therefore the patient was referred to a maxillofacial surgeon at our clinic. During her first consultation with the maxillofacial surgeon, the patient only complained about gingival recession in the palatal area of her upper-right-side teeth. The initial examination showed that the canine and both premolars had second-grade mobility (Fig. ). The probing depth of teeth 13, 14, and 15 was < 3 mm on the buccal side and 5 mm at the palatal side as the palatal gingiva were recessed leaving exposed the fist premolar and canine and less the second premolar whose exposed root surface was covered with dental plaque. The patient’s jaw underwent 3D computed tomography, which revealed bone destruction in the defect area reaching the maxillary sinus, whose mucosa was locally thickened (Fig. ). The condition of periodontium around other teeth was fine. The probing depth was < 3 mm around all other teeth. The chronic long-term lesion, with its unknown cause and unusual localization (defect in the palate side, while the marginal buccal surface bone was uninjured), caused confusion to the Oral Surgeon as the clinical findings were not characteristic of oncological tumors: such as the absence of induration of adjacent soft tissues, the boundaries were clearly visible, and the unpleasant smell characteristic of tissue collapse was not detected from the lesion. Moreover, no regional lymph nodes were palpable, and none of the patient’s close relatives were having similar lesions.\nIt was decided to remove all three teeth (13th, 14th and 15th), perform a removal of the altered soft tissues, and evaluate them histologically. After radical surgery of the defect, it was decided to reconstruct the area using allogenic bone transplant. Surgery was performed under local anesthesia. The initial prosthetic treatment plan was to insert dental implants in the area of teeth 13 and 15 about 6 months after the excision of the altered tissues and to make a fixed 3-tooth bridge on the dental implants afterward. However, after the diagnosis was histologically confirmed, prosthetic treatment was delayed for 12 months after excision in case relapse did not occur.\nThe teeth were removed during surgery, and the altered soft tissues were removed based on the clinical view, within the boundaries of healthy tissues. Soft tissues with granulations and teeth were easily separated from the bone. The bone relief was uneven but hard and was covered in a compact bone layer. The formed bone defect was more similar to uneven bone lysis than to destruction (Fig. a, b). All of the resected tissues were sent for histomorphological evaluation. After the teeth with altered tissues were removed, the bone window (uzura) to the sinus was visible, but the integrity of the membrane was intact. The membrane, as visible through the window, looked unchanged.\nSoft tissue deficit was present from the crest to the hard palate. Tumor-free margins were about 20 mm wide mesiodistally and about 15 mm wide mediolaterally (Fig. a, b). Sticky bone graft with platelet concentrate made from venous blood according to the PRGF Endoret® method, in combination with demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft was chosen for restoration of bone defect []. The soft tissue defect was covered with free gingival flap from the buccal to the palatal side. Antibiotic therapy (875 mg of amoxicillin with 125 mg clavulanic acid twice a day for 7 days) and painkillers (25 mg of Dexketoprofen according to the patient’s needs, no more than 3 times per day for 5 days) were prescribed after surgery. The wound healed without complications, and the sutures were removed after 10 days.\nThe excised gingivae and adjacent oral mucosa sent for histological examination were partially ulcerated while the underlying submucosa was consisted of complexes of atypical epithelial cells of different shapes in fibromycoidic stroma (Fig. a–d). These cells had eosinophilic cytoplasm, insignificantly polymorphic oval cores, and isolated mitoses. Part of the cytoplasm of the atypical cells contained vacuoles with erythrocytes in openings. Immunohistochemical staining with endothelial markers CD31, CD34, and ERG was positive for 100% of the tumor cells (Fig. a–c), and reaction with the epithelial marker PanCK was positive for 10% of the tumor cells. The proliferative activity of Ki-67 was about 5%. ''The included bone did not reveal any infiltration from tumor cells. The final histomorphological conclusion was epithelioid hemangioendothelioma pT1b of low malignancy in the periodontal tissues and palatal mucous membrane.\nThe further examination of patient after histopathtological results was set up during the consultation with oncologist, who indicated the need of thoracic X-ray and abdominal ultrasound to identify any possible distant metastasis. An ultrasound head and neck region examination revealed isolated II A group neck lymph nodes up to 0.5 cm in diameter, which were considered to be reactive. Suspicious lymph nodes were not found. Ultrasound of the abdomen and chest X-ray did not show any pathology.\nAfter 31 months, there have been no clinical signs of relapse. Three-dimensional computed tomography of the jaws was carried out 5 months after surgery and showed that the augmented bone had retained its shape but without complete mineralization. Considering possible relapse, the patient was scheduled for additional consultations and examinations after 3, 6, and 12 months. Prosthetic treatment was started 12 months after the tumor’s excision. Two dental implants were inserted in the area of the 13th and 15th teeth. Six months after implantation, prosthetic implants were installed with a 3-unit zirconium ceramic bridge (Fig. ). The patient had no complaints about her condition 12 months after this prosthetic treatment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical and laboratory examinations showed celiac disease with positive gliadin-antibodies. Subsequent adjustment of her diet did not result in a relief of symptoms. Instead she developed neuropsychiatric symptoms and a progressive generalized motor weakness. She was admitted to the neurology department. Brain and spinal cord MRI, CSF analysis and nerve conduction studies did not reveal any pathological findings.\nConsidering the differential diagnosis of acute tetraparesis, we checked the urine for porphyrins and found high concentrations of delta-aminolevulinic-acid and porphobilinogen. Genetic testing revealed a heterozygous mutation of the exon 9 in the HMBS-gene (Mutation c.517C > T,p.Arg173Trp).\nWe therefore diagnosed an AIP with a severe motor neuropathy. Her medication was adjusted. A treatment with high dose intravenous glucose and heme arginate was started. Despite the treatment the patient deteriorated and needed mechanical ventilation and a tracheostomy. Two weeks after admission she was tetraplegic. Her clinical condition and nerve conduction studies revealed a prominent axonal loss.\nWe repeated the treatment with heme arginate and the patient gradually improved. She got daily physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and neuropsychological support. After six weeks she was able to sit without aid. After three months she was able to stand with the support of two people. After 4 months she was able to start walking with a walker.

She had no remarkable medical or family history. She had a natural pregnancy and did not visit a hospital during the first trimester of pregnancy. The gestational age at the time of her initial hospital visit was estimated to be 15 weeks via measurement of the fetus on an ultrasound. Fetal biometry and estimated fetal weight were measured and evaluated according to the standardization committee of fetal measurement of the Japanese Society of Ultrasound in Medicine []. Head circumference (HC) was calculated from the diameter of biparietal diameter (BPD) and occipito-frontal diameter using the formula for an eclipse and evaluated according to the Hadlock et al. []. The BPD and femur length were 33 mm and 21 mm, respectively (Fig. a). At that time, there were no major anomalies, including the size and morphology of the fetal head. The estimated date of confinement was determined via ultrasound because of an unknown last menstrual period. At 23 weeks and 0 days of gestation, an ultrasound revealed a BPD of 40 mm (-5.3 standard deviations, SD), and the measured section of the BPD was poorly visualized. Additionally, observation of the fetal head using transvaginal ultrasound did not provide useful information about the cranial and cerebral defects. At 27 weeks and 5 days of gestation, an ultrasound revealed a BPD of 48 mm (-6.7 SD), however, there was difficulty visualizing the skull above the orbit and the overall growth, except for the head, was within the normal size range. At 29 weeks and 0 days of gestation, an ultrasound revealed a BPD of 43.6 mm (-8.9 SD) and a HC of 15.19 mm (-12.4 SD) (Fig. b and c). At 31 weeks and 6 days of gestation, we explained to the patient and the family that there was a possibility of microencephaly or anencephaly, and that anencephaly would result in a poor prognosis. We proposed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to the patient for a definitive diagnosis of the fetal head anomaly. However, the patient and the family refused further examination. At 34 weeks and 4 days of gestation, the patient was admitted for induction of labor due to the patient preferences. Elevation of the fetal head due to cervical dilatation by insertion of a metreurynter permitted confirmation of the structure of the fetal skull. MRI and 3-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) were performed to confirm the absence of anencephaly. 3D-CT revealed the presence of a fetal skull, a prominent occipital bone, and a sloping forehead (Fig. a and b). MRI showed a cerebral sickle, cerebellar tent, cerebral defects, a hypoplastic cerebellum, and a normal brain stem (Fig. c). The presence of the skull, cerebellum, and brainstem allowed us to diagnose the fetus with microhydranencephaly, rather than anencephaly. This diagnosis indicated that the fetus may be able to survive after delivery. Thus, the induction of labor was stopped, and the patient and the family were counseled for treatment. Vaginal delivery was scheduled with an exception for a cesarean section in the case of maternal indication. For the infant, noninvasive resuscitation treatment, except for tracheal intubation and chest compression, was scheduled for after delivery. Because the patient had cancelled many scheduled visits, she was hospitalized until delivery. At 36 weeks and 6 days of gestation, she had a premature rupture of the membranes, and delivered vaginally the following day without shoulder dystocia due to the small fetal head. The baby was a male weighing 2342 g, with a HC of 24 cm (-5.4 SD according to the Japanese neonatal data []) and Apgar scores of 1, 5, and 8 after 1, 5, and 10 min, respectively. Umbilical artery blood pH, pCO2, pO2, and base excess were 7.34, 42.7 mm Hg, 22.5 mm Hg, and − 3.5 mmol/L, respectively. After birth, the baby had spontaneous respiration. Both eyes and the nose had a normal appearance, but the head was flat above the forehead, with a suspected partial head defect with a sloping forehead (Fig. b and c, and d). Skin defects were found in the parietal region (Fig. a), and encephalocele was suspected. The skin lesion was taped, and healing was confirmed after 12 days, with no signs of infection or leakage of cerebrospinal fluid. Although the sucking reflex was observed, swallowing movements appeared difficult. On day 11 after birth, a gastric tube was inserted, and tube feeding was started. On day 32 after birth, an MRI revealed the absence of cerebral tissue; instead, a membranous structure was present and hydrocephalus was evident (Fig. ), which was consistent with microhydranencephaly. Screenings for rubella virus, herpesvirus, cytomegalovirus, and toxoplasma infections causing hydrocephalus were all negative. Chromosomal analysis with G-banding yielded 46, XY, with and inv (9) (p12 q13) harboring less clinically significant abnormalities.

Chest computed tomography (CT) showed left pleural effusion. Hydrothorax analysis demonstrated adenosine deaminase activity of 67 U/L and T cell test positive for TB infection, which suggested high possibility of TB infection. She thus received anti-TB treatment, including 0.3 g isoniazid (INH) (quaque die, qd), 0.6 g rifampicin (qd), 0.5 g pyrazinamide (ter in die, tid), and 0.75 g ethambutol (qd).\nOn January 14, the patient was hospitalized again in the initial hospital for repeated fever. During the treatment, she was found enlargement of supraclavicular and mediastinal lymph nodes, hypoechoic nodules outside the envelope of the left external lobe of liver (suggestive of involvement of lymph nodes), splenomegaly, multiple hypoechoic area within spleen (suggestive of TB), and a small amount of pelvic effusion. On February 2, she received supraclavicular lymph node puncture for histological observation, which showed many neutrophils, lymphocytes and phagocytes and a few epithelioid cells. This indicated that the possibility of scrofula could not be excluded. Since April 1 she began to exhibit symptoms of chest distress. The chest CT reexamination on April 6 revealed patchy and nodular shadow with increased density in the right upper lung, enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum and right supraclavicular region, with uneven enhancement, and necrotic areas (liquefaction area) in the interior. Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes obviously compressed to narrow the trachea. The main bronchus on both sides were clear, and no obvious effusion was observed in the thorax on both sides (Fig. ).\nThe patient was then admitted to Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital (Shanghai, China) for further treatment. After admission, the patient underwent physical examination: temperature 37 °C, pulse 80 times/min, respiration 18 times/min, and blood pressure 130/80 mmHg. She had a clear consciousness, without cyanosis in the mouth and lips, and had thick breath sound from both lungs, without obvious dry and wet rales. The heart rate was 80 times/min and heart rhythms were regular. Abdomen was smooth and soft, liver and spleen did not reach below costal, and pathological sign was (−). No edema was seen in both lower limbs. Blood gas analysis for pulmonary function on April 9, 2018 showed: pH 7.41, partial pressure of carbon dioxide 39.4 mmHg, oxygen partial pressure 108 mmHg↑, total hemoglobin 11.1 g/dL↓, oxygen saturation 99.2%, standard base excess 0.6 mmol/L, actual base excess 0.6 mmol/L, actual bicarbonate 24.7 mmol/L, standard bicarbonate 25.0 mmol/L, and alveolar artery oxygen partial pressure difference 0.0 mmHg ↓. Blood routine analysis on April 10, 2018 were as follows: hemoglobin 106.0 g/L↓, red blood cells 4.11*1012/L, white blood cells 5.19*109/L, neutrophils % 66.3, lymphocytes % 21.4, monocytes % 9.6↑, eosinophils % 2.5, basophils % 0.2, absolute neutrophils amount 3.44*109/L, absolute lymphocyte amount 1.11*109/L, absolute monocytes count 0.50*109/L, platelets 269*109/L, hematocrit 0.323 L/L↓, mean red blood cell volume 79 fL↓, and mean hemoglobin content 26 pg↓. Blood biochemical assay on April 10, 2018 showed: r-glutamine transferase 42 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 13 U/L, aspertate aminotransferase 27 U/L, aspertate aminotransferase isoenzyme 6 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 87 U/L, total bilirubin 11.0 μmol/L, direct bilirubin 3.6 μmol/L, total bile acid 2.9 μmol/L, total protein 78 g/L, albumin 42 g/L, globulin 35 g/L, albumin/globulin 1.2 ↓, prealbumin 185 mg/L ↓, α- L-fucosidase 17 U/L, uric acid 530 μmol/L ↑, urea nitrogen 3.3 mmol/L, creatinine 43 μmol/L↓, glucose 5.2 mmol/L, potassium 3.6 mmol/L, sodium 139 mmol/L, chlorine 106 mmol/L, calcium 2.40 mmol/L, and phosphorus 1.52 mmol/L.\nThe patient continued receiving systemic anti-TB treatment during the whole course, including 0.3 g INH (peros, po/qd), 0.6 g rifampicin (po/qd), 0.75 g ethambutol (po/qd), and 0.5 g pyrazinamide (po/tid). All the drugs were purchased from the Shanghai Sine Pharma (Shanghai, China). On April 11, she received EBUS- TBNA treatment, namely, EBUS examination, with the help of an ultrasonic tracheoscope (UMBS20-26R, Olympus, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan) and the corresponding EU-C2000 ultrasound processing apparatus (Olympus), to observe the enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes at the Four Right group, followed by puncturing and aspirating all the pus (about 5 ml) from the abscess with a specific 21-G needle (NA-201SX-4022, Olympus) (Fig. ). Then 0.1 g INH injection (Southwest Pharma, Chongqing, China) was administered through the needle during EBUS-TBNA. The pus underwent smear detection to show positive for acid bacillus and simultaneously, the pus was sent out for cytopathological examination. There was no obvious main complaint of discomfort from the patient after operation.\nCytopathological examination for the aspirated pus indicated inflammatory necrosis tissues and a few epithelioid cells (Fig. ). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay showed the pus sample was positive for the detection of prokaryotic 16S RNA gene, RV0577 coding an important antigen RV0577 in TB patients [, ], and IS6110 fragment, an insert fragment within TB [, ], indicating the presence of featured DNA fragments of TB. The smear examination of pus showed positive for acid bacillus. These indicate the infection of Mycobacterium TB in the patient. Collectively, the MLNTB was determined.\nOn April 24 and May 10, she received two times of EBUS-TBNA to puncture and aspirate pus, 2 ml for each time, and to administer 0.1 g INH injection each time. After that, the symptoms of chest distress were obviously relieved. On May 29, she received electronic bronchoscopic examination and was found granulomatous neoplasm at the EBUS-TBNA site on the trachea wall (Fig. ).\nTo treat the granulomatous neoplasm occurring after the EBUS-TBNA procedure, the patient then received local clamp removal treatment and cryotherapy for 90 s after EBUS-TBNA on May 29 and Jul 19, respectively, by using a K320 cryosurgery treatment machine (Beijing Kooland Medical Equipment Co., Beijing, China), with the probe temperature of − 40 ~ − 75 °C. Chest CT reexamination on May 30 indicated the MLNTA lesion was obviously decreased (Fig. ). Chest CT reexamination on July 17 revealed that the MLNTA lesion had been basically absorbed, and that on September 28 confirmed that the MLNTA lesion had been completely absorbed (Fig. ). Electronic bronchoscopic reexamination on July 19 showed the granulomatous neoplasm at the EBUS-TBNA site on the trachea wall was obviously decreased, and that on September 30 demonstrated that the granulomatous neoplasm on the trachea wall was entirely invisible (Fig. ). At this point, the symptoms of chest distress were completely disappeared, and the patient achieved satisfactory treatment. The timeline for the diagnosis and treatment of MLNTA in this patient was summarized in Fig. .\nThis study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine.

There was also polyhydramnios and there was suspicion of a form of CRS based on lower limb and vertebral anomalies. Prenatal laboratory tests, including cell-free fetal DNA, were all normal except for her rubella nonimmune status. The family declined to pursue amniocentesis. There was no exposure to teratogens, illicit drugs or alcohol. There was no significant family history forthcoming and no consanguinity. There were no glycemic abnormalities during pregnancy.

Spinal ultrasound (US) revealed absence of the sacrum with the conus having a blunt end at the tip at the T12-L1 disc space. Renal US showed multicystic dyplastic right kidney, duplicated right and left renal collecting system, and distended right ureter. Head US revealed premature gyral and sulcal pattern that was, however, appropriate for the gestational age. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine at a month of age revealed a rudimentary sacrum, absence of coccyx and blunting of spinal cord at T 11 and features suggesting a type 1 CRS (). An echocardiogram revealed small mid-muscular VSD with left to right shunting. A karyotype and chromosomal microarray did not reveal any abnormalities. She underwent a colostomy and mucus fistula creation within 2 days when a rectovaginal fistula was also noticed. Prophylactic antibiotics was initiated due to urinary tract anomalies.

According to the history-taking at the university hospital, when the patient was around 10 years old, the tooth developed severe caries and was restored using composite resin at another private dental clinic. As the patient did not remember the name and address of the dental clinic where this initial treatment was performed, no further information on the initial treatment was available.\nThe medical histories of the patient and her family were non-contributory and no traumatic history of the frontal teeth was revealed by history-taking. At the time of the first examination at the university hospital, swelling was observed and the left maxillary incisor was discolored (A).\nSlight pressure pain and notable fistulization were identified in the swollen area. However, no spontaneous pain or significant perpendicular or horizontal percussion pain was identified. The probing depth of the left maxillary incisor was within 2 mm and tooth movement was within physiological limits; thus, root fracture was not assumed. The palatal side was sealed with hydraulic cement. Dental radiographs taken at the first visit to the university hospital as well as radiographs provided by the private dental clinic revealed that the width of the root canal adjacent to the apex of the left maxillary incisor was narrower than that of the maxillary right central incisor ( and B). The upper two-thirds of the crown side were filled with Calcipex II® from the previous treatment. Moreover, the width of the periodontal ligament space was slightly enlarged ( and B).\nThe maxillary left central incisor was isolated with a rubber dam. Standard endodontic treatments including the measurement of the root canal length by electronic apex locator, reaming, filing and root irrigation were conducted. An electron apex locator indicated an orifice of the lateral accessory canal at the middle of the root because the working length at which the meter indicated the apex was shorter than expected. A slight exudate infiltrated on the paper point when it reached the orifice of the lateral accessory canal through the main root canal. The patient felt pain when endodontic files were inserted over the orifice of the lateral accessory canal.\nCone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) demonstrated a horizontal accessory canal at the labial side of the root in the sagittal section (A, arrow), bone resorption (length = 6 mm, width = 5.5 mm) whose center was positioned at the foramen of the horizontal accessory canal on the horizontal section (B, arrow) and local enlargement of the periodontal ligament space on the mesial side of the middle part of the root (C). In contrast to the labial and medial sides of the middle part of the root, the bone surrounding the apical apex was not resorbed and labial bone resorption did not reach the apical apex (A,C). A schematic view of the periapical region based on CBCT analyses showed 4.0 mm and 2.0 mm distances from the anatomical apex to the orifice of the laterally localized accessory root canal and from the foramen to the orifice of the laterally localized accessory root canal, respectively; the angle between the main root canal and the laterally localized accessory root canal was 85°, which verified that the laterally localized accessory root canal occurred naturally rather than being caused by an iatrogenic perforation (D).\nThe above findings suggested that inflammation spread into the periodontal ligament tissue from the horizontal accessory canal but not from the apical apex and this case was diagnosed as laterally localized inflammation caused by infection of the accessory root canal. Therefore, due to continuous exudate from the accessory root canal, we considered it prudent to discontinue the non-surgical endodontic treatment and proposed exploratory surgery to the patient in order to directly examine and disinfect the lateral accessory canal under a microscope. We obtained informed consent from her and her mother.\nAt the time of the surgery, local anesthesia was administered, the target side was opened and granulation tissue was removed. The foramen of the accessory canal was identified by microscopy (A, arrowhead) and the dentin tissue surrounding the foramen was drilled out using a diamond bur of 0.5 mm in diameter to remove potentially infected surrounding dentin (B). After the cavity was disinfected with 10% sodium hypochlorite (NeoCleaner®, Neo Seiyaku, Nagoya, Japan) and washed with saline, a No. 25 K-file was inserted into the main canal in order to prevent resin material from leaking into the main canal, thereby preventing subsequent non-surgical endodontic treatment. Subsequently, the cavity was treated using a self-etching dentin-adhesive system (Clearfil MegaBond®, Kuraray Medical, Okayama, Japan) and filled with resin (Beautifil flow F02®, Shofu, Kyoto, Japan) (C). Twelve days after the surgery, no swelling or clinical symptoms were observed, the sutures were removed and the affected area was irrigated with saline.\nOver the next 40 days, supportive non-surgical endodontic treatment was conducted five times. At this stage, the root canal length was successfully measured and a working length of 25.0 mm from the top of the crown was set. The apex was enlarged until No. 55 with a K-file and the prepared root canal was irrigated with 3% EDTA solution (Smearclean®, Nippon Shika Yakuhin Co., Ltd., Yamaguchi, Japan). Calcipex II® was used as a drug for the root canal and glass polyalkenoate cement (Base Cement®, Shofu, Kyoto, Japan) was used as a temporary sealing. The fitness of the gutta-percha points (GC Dental Industrial Corp, Tokyo, Japan) in the apex region was examined (D) and then the root was filled by the lateral condensation method using Grossman’s root canal sealer (Nishika Canal Sealer Eugenol Quick E-Q®, Nippon Shika Yakuhin Co., Ltd., Yamaguchi, Japan) (E).\nFourteen days after root canal obturation, the accessible palatal cavity was filled with the composite resin for a permanent restoration. Three months, one year and two years after root canal obturation, CBCT analyses were performed. The lateral canal remained closed by the filled resin material even after two years and the absence of labial bone resorption was chronologically confirmed on cross, sagittal and horizontal sections (). Furthermore, no recurrence of gingival swelling was confirmed on photographs and no clinical symptoms were observed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pain was aggravated by movement, worse at night, and was relieved by taking painkiller. She walked with a limping gait. The swelling gradually enlarged for three months until she was completely bed ridden before being transferred to our hospital. Her appetite was reduced where she lost 5kg of weight within the three months. She denied any recent trauma, fever, family history of cancer and other joint pain or swelling.\nOur examination revealed a diffuse swelling at the left iliac region, which was tender, warm, hard in consistency, not mobile and not fluctuant. Her left hip range of movement was limited due to pain. Neurovascular assessment of the left lower limb was normal. Patient was afebrile throughout her illness. All blood investigation was normal except an increase in the level of lactate dehydrogenase (733 U/L).\nPlain radiograph of pelvis () showed a lytic lesion at left iliac region with narrow zone of transition. There was soft tissue shadow extension and no involvement of the left acetabulum. Chest radiograph and CT thorax was normal. MRI () showed a well demarcated lesion with multiple fluid-fluid levels at left ilium which was suggestive of ABC. The gluteal and iliopsoas muscles were pushed by an expansile ilium with no evidence of infiltration. HPE result of left iliac core needle biopsy () showed cystic spaces contain blood with the presence of macrophages, hemosiderin laden macrophages and reactive fibroblasts, but no atypical sarcomatous cell was seen. The findings were consistent with ABC.\nPercutaneous sclerosing injection of the left iliac lesion () was done as a treatment for ABC. Post procedure we noted blood oozing from the injection site. The site of injection was sutured, and bleeding stopped. Patient also developed popliteal vein thrombosis due to prolonged immobilisation, which was treated with subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium 40mg twice daily therapeutic dose. On day 10 post sclerosing injection, patient still had active bleeding from the left iliac injection site. She developed tachycardia with pulse rate of 110-120 and the blood pressure was 90/60mmHg. Haemoglobin level dropped to 6g/dL. Coagulation profile result was normal. Emergency hemipelvectomy with posterior flap was performed for the patient (). Intra-operative tissue was sent for HPE (); results revealed lesion composed of multiple cystic spaces containing blood which were separated by irregular septa and lined by a mantle of atypical sarcomatous cells admixed with multinucleated giant cells. These atypical sarcomatous cells are pleomorphic, hyperchromatic and have an irregular round to oval nuclei. A diagnosis of left iliac TOS was made. Her hemipelvectomy operation scar healed after three weeks and she was on monthly regular follow-up. Five months after operation, she developed left psoas muscle and lung metastasis. Despite chemotherapy, she eventually succumbed to disseminated metastases, obstructive uropathy and bowel obstruction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
aLExA rEyes,18,F,O+,Hypertension,17-05-2021,Stephen Rodriguez,Inc Peck,Medicare,38969.08818,278,Elective,21-05-2021,Ibuprofen,Abnormal,"A 18-year-old female patient (40 kg) with MDS-EB-2 (myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blasts) with lower cellularity than expected based upon the patient's age underwent allo-HSCT using cells obtained by leukapheresis from a 100% HLA-matched unrelated donor (ABO A+/O+; CMV+/−), with a CD34+ cell dose of 1.48 × 106/kg. The patient was conditioned with busulfan (3.2 mg/kg × 4) and cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg total dose) and the immunosupressors, cyclosporine and methotrexate. On day 90 of the procedure, blood counts were 0.4 × 109/L for neutrophils and <20 × 109/L for platelets (with daily platelets support), with 100% donor chimerism. Because of the evident neutropenia, combined with gastrointestinal GvHD grades III-IV, we sought to boost the allo-HSCT with CD34+-enriched cells. As there was a CliniMACS Prodigy available in our clean room, we used this platform and estimated an initial amount of ~10 × 106/kg CD34+ cells, expecting to obtain 5-6 × 106/kg of cells needed for the transplant. Two days were required for collection of donor products, which were pooled for analysis in a final volume of 650 mL. Automated blood cell counting gave a total white cell count (WCC) of 193 × 106/mL. Flow cytometry analysis showed 601.72 × 103 CD34+/µL and 0.43% CD34+ cells, giving an initial CD34+ dose of 9.77 × 106 cells/kg and 23.82% CD3+ T lymphocytes (Table ). The CliniMACS Prodigy system included a TS310 tubing set, 2 vials of CliniMACS CD34 Reagent (monoclonal CD34 antibody coupled to superparamagnetic nanobeads), and 10 mL of human IgG (Flebogamma, 5%). Washing buffer was CliniMACS PBS/EDTA 0.5% human albumin solution (3 L), and cells were eluted in NaCl 0.5% human albumin solution. Installation took 1 hour and CD34+ selection took 5 hours (see Table ). During the process, the platform alerted us with a “process out of specification” alarm indicating: “Based on entered WBC concentration, target cell frequency, and product volume, the resulting labeled cell count and/or total WBC count exceeded the specification of large scale LP-34 enrichment process.” We confirmed the warning and started the process out of specification (Table ). The final product was eluted in 70 mL of elution buffer. We removed a sample for sterility testing and quality controls. Postselection automated cell count gave a total WCC of 6.6 × 106/mL. Flow cytometry analysis showed 5577.66 × 103 CD34+/µL and 96% CD34+ cells, giving a postselection CD34+ dose of 9.76 × 106/kg and consequently 100% CD34+ recovery. Postselection CD3+ was 0.23% (4.45 Log reduction in total CD3 cells) (Table ). Forty milliliters of this product were infused 2 hours after selection (CD34+ dose of 5.76 × 106/kg and 15 000 CD3+ cells/kg). The remaining 30 mL (CD34+ dose of 4 × 106/kg) was cryopreserved. Fourteen days after CD34+ boost, the patient showed reconstitution with neutrophils at 7.4 × 109/L and platelets at 97 × 109/L, without support.\nWe sought to identify the parameters that may play a role in the positive outcome of the CD34+ cell selection process to benefit patients in need of this cell product. The CD34+ enrichment program in the CliniMACS Prodigy software allows two different scales: normal (0.6 × 109 target cells/ 6 × 1010 total cells) and large (1.2 × 109 target cells/ 12 × 1010 total cells), both in a volume 50-660 mL. Compared with the previous validations of CD34+ selections using the CliniMACS Prodigy, our attention was drawn to the large initial volume of cells. As is common when validating a new technique or methodology, the optimal starting material collections were used (6 × 1010 total cells for normal scale or 12 × 1010 total cells for large scale, with a relatively high percentage of CD34+ cells in the smallest possible volume). Platelets in the starting product are believed to decrease cell recovery by interfering with the binding between the immunomagnetic reagent and the CD34+ cells, and for this reason the program includes a platelet removal step. When starting with a small volume, the entire product is loaded and only one volume adjustment is performed before the program moves to the platelet wash step. In this context, our starting material could be considered nonideal, as the CliniMACS Prodigy needed to load the product three times (Table ). Each time, the volume was adjusted, cells were concentrated and supernatants removed. Accordingly, more platelets were removed in each step. It is possible that superior results are obtainable with more diluted leukapheresis collections, in which more product loading and volume adjustments are needed. We would encourage centers using the CliniMACS Prodigy to evaluate larger and less concentrated starting materials to test the reduction in platelets and, consequently, its positive impact on selection efficiency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was no history of similar illness among the family members or first-degree relatives, chest irradiation, or any use of oral contraceptive pills. Her menarche was at 13 years with regular menstrual cycle. Vitals were stable. All the laboratory and biochemical parameters along with systemic examination were within the normal limit. Right breast examination revealed a freely mobile mass involving central area of the breast along with right upper and lower quadrant approximately the size of 10 cm × 9 cm with no adherence to the skin or fixity to the posterior wall; however, overlying skin was slightly tensed with distended superficial veins (Figure ). It was nontender, well circumscribed, and firm in consistency. Nipple appeared slightly fissured. Axillary lymph nodes were not palpable. Left breast examination was normal. Ultrasonography of right breast showed inhomogeneous solid mass measuring 85.9 × 74.6 mm with posterior acoustic enhancement in right breast suggestive of fibroadenoma. Pathological examination with FNAC was not possible due to reluctance of the patient. Mammography bilateral breast showed dense fibro-glandular parenchyma along with well-defined, large oval-shaped equal to low-density lesion with lobulated margin in the peri-areolar region of the right breast (Figure ).

Her pain was progressive, dull-aching, and non-radiating in nature. The severity of pain was seven out of ten. She had no other gastrointestinal symptoms. The review of her systems was unremarkable. She had no history of surgeries or allergies to drugs or food. She denied the use of herbal medications, tobacco, and alcohol. She was not sexually active and did not have any exposure to animals. Past medical history revealed significance for a four-year history of uncontrolled type-two diabetes mellitus which was managed with insulin therapy. Recently, she was started on three mg of liraglutide for the management of her diabetes mellitus and obesity. Family history was notable for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity.\nOn physical examination, she was found to be vitally stable. Her body mass index was 31.9 kg/m2. Her lungs were clear to auscultation with normal heart sounds. Abdominal exam displayed a distended abdomen with epigastric tenderness.\nLaboratory results revealed a blood glucose level of 170 mg/dL (normal range: less than 100 mg/dL). Her glycated hemoglobin A1C was 8.4% (normal: less than 6.5%). Her blood test results for creatinine, potassium, sodium, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase were within normal levels.\nX-ray of abdomen displayed a non-obstructive gas pattern without intestinal dilatation. Abdominal computed tomography showed an isolated moderate-grade gastric distension, with smooth thin wall and no evidence of distal gastric, pyloric, or proximal duodenal obstructing masses (Figure ). Afterward, the patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which exhibited no proof of an obstructing lesion. Overall, the imaging studies excluded potential etiologies of mechanical obstruction and a diagnosis of liraglutide-induced gastroparesis was made.\nConsequently, gastric suctioning through a nasogastric tube was carried out to treat her condition and the intake of liraglutide was ceased.

It was associated with nausea, vomiting, early satiety, and progressive weight loss due to poor oral intake. Previously, her abdominal pain was thought to be caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease. However, a trial of proton pump inhibitor therapy had not improved her symptoms. On physical examination, she was noted to be cachectic. Findings consistent with the diagnosis of RTS included fish-like facies, congenital deafness, widely distributed poikiloderma (areas of hyper and hypopigmented areas giving the appearance of mottling), and telangiectasias. She had moderate abdominal tenderness.\nContrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed gastric and colonic wall thickening, small volume ascites, and borderline upper abdominal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with endoscopic ultrasound EUS revealed significantly abnormal mucosa of the gastric cardia. Findings included variegation in mucosal appearance, ulceration, and thickening, highly suggestive of a diffuse infiltrative process with circumferential extension to the level of the pylorus. Figures - reveal the irregular areas of gastric mucosa as observed on EGD. Extensive infiltration of the stomach wall can be seen on axial (Figure ) and coronal (Figure ) CT images.\nGastric biopsies confirmed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet-ring cell features. Staging laparoscopy showed no peritoneal involvement. She was provided enteral nutrition via jejunostomy tube in preparation for the surgery. Subsequently, she underwent a total gastrectomy with lymph node dissection. R1 resection was achieved with positive proximal and distal surgical margins. Lymphovascular invasion and lymph node involvement (seven out of 16 resected lymph nodes were positive for malignant cells) were observed in the surgical specimen. Pathologic stage was finalized as IIIB (pT3N3aM0) with histologic grade G3 (poorly differentiated).\nBecause of poor baseline performance status and severe protein-calorie malnutrition, she was deemed unfit for adjuvant chemotherapy. After a detailed discussion with her family, it was decided to closely monitor the patient with serial body imaging. Unfortunately, her postoperative course was complicated by recurrent episodes of large bowel obstruction, eventually requiring surgical bypass of the obstruction by colo-colostomy (side to side anastomosis of the cecum to the sigmoid colon). Intraoperatively, there was evidence of peritoneal recurrence of gastric cancer, which was confirmed on biopsy of one of the serosal lesions.

She denied any history of fever, hematuria or stone passage. Past history was significant for right open pyelolithotomy four years back. According to patient, no ureteric stent was placed at the time of surgery. Her examination revealed a healed scar in the right flank region, no tenderness or discharging sinus was appreciated. An unenhanced CT abdomen showed a density representing calculus at the lower pole of the right kidney measuring 18 x 9mm (Figure ). The left kidney and both ureters were unremarkable.\nAfter thorough discussion with the patient regarding available options, she opted for right percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). Percutaneous nephrolithotomy was performed in a prone position. Lower pole posterior calyx was punctured and tract dilated up to 21French using metallic dilators and 22Fr Amplatz sheath was placed under fluoroscopic guidance. However surprisingly no stone was appreciated endoscopically after a thorough search in the lower pole calyx and rest of the collecting system (Figure ).\nAfter an extensive search and fluoroscopic guidance, a foreign body was found embedded in the mucosa of the lower pole calyx. This was approximately 1.5cm in size and removed with forceps in pieces with great difficulty. Percutaneous nephrostomy tube (PCN) was placed at the end of the procedure. On careful inspection of the foreign body, it turned out to be a piece of rubber tubing similar to abdominal drains. It was postulated to be a broken drain piece left during previous pyelolithotomy (Figure ).\nOur patient underwent non-contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (Figure ). Currently a contrast enhanced imaging is advisable for patients requiring intervention for renal stone []. We supplemented non-contrast-enhanced CT with per-operative retrograde pyelography to plan endoscopic access and define intrarenal anatomy. As stone formation in this young patient was most likely secondary to foreign body formation we have not performed 24-hour urine studies. However, she had basic biochemistry including serum creatinine, electrolytes, uric acid, calcium; besides urinalysis and culture which were unremarkable.\nThe preliminary diagnosis was renal stone and even on preoperative CT scan foreign body was not identifiable due to a similar density of drain and renal stones. As there was a previous history of open renal surgery, a forgotten double-J stent was a possibility, however, there was no history of ureteric stent insertion during the previous pyelolithotomy nor was a foreign body visible on CT scan. In retrospect on the coronal section of the CT scan, one can make out a rounded outline of a broken drain piece (Figure ).\nThe patient had a postoperative smooth recovery and became asymptomatic.

Computed tomogram (CT) of the left distal femur revealed a sclerotic and lytic lesion causing partial cortical destruction with soft tissue extension to the medial part of the surrounding muscles. No distant metastasis, including to the lung and regional lymph nodes, were observed on chest or abdominal CT. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an intraosseous lesion combined with an unclear circumscribed extraosseous mass, which was hypointense on T1-weighted (Fig. c) and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Unevenly contrasted lesion was observed on enhanced MRI (Fig. d). An open biopsy for the left distal femoral lesion was performed. Proliferation of pleomorphic spindle cells with nuclear atypia and brisk mitosis, producing a large amount of lace-like osteoid, were observed (Fig. e). A systemic Technetium-99 m scintigraphy (bone scan) (Fig. a) revealed other bone lesions of the left occipital bone (Fig. b) and right proximal humerus (Fig. c), in addition to the left distal femoral lesion (Fig. d), although no evident physical findings on either the right proximal humerus or left occipital bone were observed. However, a relatively strong uptake was observed at all three lesions. Thallium scintigram also revealed the strong accumulation of tracers only on the three bone lesions. A close examination by MRI revealed the enhancement of right proximal humeral bone lesion and left occipital bone lesion (Fig. e, f), the same as the left distal femoral lesion (Fig. g). Based on the histological findings, multiple bone lesions, and absence of visceral lesion, the clinical diagnosis of synchronous multicentric osteosarcoma (SMOS) was made. There is much debate in the previous studies as to whether it represents multiple primary tumors or metastatic disease. However, the case for multiple primary tumors was favored, because there was no obvious route for spread if the lungs were tumor-free, which was thought to rule out hematogenous metastasis. The prognosis of SMOS is generally considered to be poor according to the findings of previous studies [–].\nShe underwent five courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with a regimen of doxorubicin and cisplatin, which was the same as the standard regimen for the treatment of osteosarcoma. The dose of doxorubicin was 60 mg/m2, and that of cisplatin was 120 mg/m2. The chemotherapy was performed every three weeks. After the completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the uptake of all lesions on the bone scan diminished (Fig. a–d), and the enhancement of all lesions on MRI decreased (Fig. e–g). The accumulation of tracers on thallium scintigram also decreased. The chemotherapy was observed to be highly effective based on the radiological findings. The alkali-phosphatase level dramatically decreased and become normal in laboratory tests.\nSurgical treatment of wide excision for the primary lesion of the left distal femur and reconstruction with megaprosthesis was planned at 4 months after the diagnosis. The distal femoral lesion was widely excised with extraosseous lesion and biopsy tract, preserving popliteal artery, veins and sciatic nerve (Fig. a). The bone was cut at 3 cm proximal from the edge of the bone lesion. A portion of the vastus medialis and intermedius were excised along with the tumor. The iodine-coated tumor prosthesis [–] was used for reconstruction (Fig. b, c). The pathological findings for the excised specimen revealed total necrosis of the lesion (Fig. d), and free surgical margins for both the bone and soft tissue lesions of the left distal femur.\nSince physical recovery from the primary surgery and wound healing were observed, adjuvant chemotherapy was resumed at seventeen days postoperatively for the residual lesions of the humerus and occipital bone. The regimen for an adjuvant chemotherapy was the same as a neoadjuvant chemotherapy. A mildly decreased cardiac function was observed on echocardiogram after the completion of the first course of adjuvant chemotherapy, and chemotherapy with another regimen of high-dose methotrexate (10 g/m2) and vincristine (2 mg/body) was performed for the second course of adjuvant chemotherapy. The improvement of cardiac function was confirmed, and the doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) and cisplatin (96 mg/m2, 80% dose of standard regimen) were given again for the third course of adjuvant chemotherapy. A total of eight courses of chemotherapy were completed, including three courses of adjuvant chemotherapy. The total dose of doxorubicin and cisplatin was 420 mg/m2 and 816 mg/m2, respectively. The humeral lesion had almost completely disappeared radiologically, and the occipital lesion was only slightly visible on images. Both the alkali-phosphatase level and the lactate dehydrogenase level remained normal in laboratory tests.\nTumor excision of both the humeral lesion and the occipital lesion, and reconstruction using a frozen autograft, rather than a tumor prosthesis or synthetics, was planned at 6 months after the diagnosis, because a histological analysis demonstrated that chemotherapy showed good efficacy in the treatment of the primary lesion. For the humeral lesion, the tumor location was identified using a fluoroscopy, based on preoperative MRI findings. For the skull lesion, the tumor location was identified with the assistance of a navigation system. At first, tumor excision for the occipital lesion was performed with a margin of at least 2 cm (Fig. a), and the excised bone was treated with liquid nitrogen for 20 min (Fig. b). The frozen autograft was dissolved at room temperature for 15 min, and washed by 0.3% iodine saline and distilled water (Fig. c). The autograft was returned to the original position with plate fixation (Fig. d). Then, hemicortical excision for the right proximal humeral lesion was performed with a margin of at least 2 cm, preserving axillary nerve, and then the excised bone was treated with liquid nitrogen for 20 min (Fig. a). The frozen autograft was dissolved at room temperature for 15 min, and washed by 0.3% iodine saline and distilled water (Fig. b). The autograft was returned to the original position with screw fixation (Fig. c, d).\nFurther chemotherapy was not administered after the second surgery because the adverse events due to chemotherapy, such as a myelosuppression and a mildly-decreased cardiac function, were observed. She was discharged from the hospital after the recovery from the surgery was confirmed. She was prudently observed under active surveillance, and underwent close follow-up examinations in an outpatient clinic every 3 or 4 months after discharge.\nAt 68 months’ follow-up after the detection of SMOS, a disease-free condition with neither local recurrence nor metastasis was obtained, and bone union for the humerus and skull lesion had also been achieved on images (Fig. a–c). The patient’s cardiac function was normal on an echocardiogram, and no other adverse events was observed at the last follow-up. Both the alkali-phosphatase level and the lactate dehydrogenase level remained normal in laboratory tests. An excellent function for both the upper extremity (30/30 points) and lower extremity (30/30 points) according to the International Society of Limb Salvage (ISOLS) score had been acquired. No neurological deficit was observed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ELIzabETh joneS,18,F,O-,Diabetes,07-02-2020,Edwin Alvarez II,and Sons Kim,Aetna,32415.99458,308,Emergency,27-02-2020,Ibuprofen,Normal,"The patient was an 18-year-old Chinese American female being evaluated in the Adoption Medicine Clinic (AMC) at the University of Minnesota. She had been adopted at age 3 years from China. Prior to adoption, she had lived in an orphanage after being relinquished by her biological parents at the age of 5 months. Her previous medical history included a ventricular septal defect (VSD) that was repaired prior to adoption and bilateral strabismus that had been repaired during childhood. She had a resting bilateral hand tremor that was diagnosed as psychogenic by Pediatric Neurology. There was a history of delayed developmental milestones, including gross motor and speech delays. The patient did not start walking until approximately age 24 months. She did not start speaking in phrases or sentences until age 4. Following adoption, the patient’s adoptive mother attempted to obtain resources to help support the patient’s growth and development. She received occupational therapy services from age 3 to 4 years, but this had been discontinued due to lack of insurance coverage. Throughout childhood the family had difficulty obtaining appropriate therapeutic support, and the patient was moved to multiple school districts to identify and obtain resources. She was able to secure financial support from county services at age 16. Despite these challenges, the patient was able to continue to generally progress with her developmental milestones.\nThe patient had a history of intellectual disability. She had a school individualized education program (IEP) evaluation at age 13 that revealed a full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) of 70. She was provided school services under the category Developmental Cognitive Disability, mild-moderate. She was evaluated by Pediatric Neuropsychology at age 15 due to ongoing concerns for intellectual disability and developmental delays and was diagnosed with mild intellectual disability and static encephalopathy. She was subsequently evaluated by Pediatric Neurology, who agreed with these diagnoses. The patient also underwent diagnostic testing for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) at age 15, which was not consistent with an ASD diagnosis.\nAs the patient reached adolescence, she began to have significant difficulty with emotional regulation and mood and was diagnosed with severe depression. She was hospitalized on two separate occasions due to concerns for anxiety, depression, self-injurious behaviors, and suicidal ideation. She was referred for psychotherapy and had been maintained on mood-stabilizing medications, including fluoxetine and escitalopram. She was taking escitalopram at the time of evaluation. The patient previously had dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy. She had also been treated for an eating disorder at an outpatient program. Throughout adolescence, she continued with social isolation and self-injurious behaviors, including skin picking and cutting, although her mood had improved following initiation of medications and therapy. She had recently started with a mental health coach prior to her evaluation. The patient and adoptive mother had ongoing attachment difficulties. The patient also reported a history of poor sleep related to anxiety and use of electronics prior to bedtime. She was taking melatonin.\nAt the time of her visit to the AMC, despite the presence of known global delays, diagnosis of mild intellectual disability, and a history of congenital cardiac disease, the patient had not undergone genetic testing. The family had established contact with the patient’s biological family. There was no known consanguinity between parents. She had an older sibling with a hand deformity and a younger sibling without identified medical concerns. Neither sibling was reported to have developmental delays. There was no family history of substance abuse or mental health issues. The patient had an adaptive IEP with occupational therapy support and a plan to transition to adulthood following her senior year of high school. Of note, the patient had spent the majority of ninth grade homebound due to anxiety symptoms and was in a half-day therapy program throughout tenth grade.\nOn clinical evaluation, the patient displayed appropriate growth and physical development. Weight-for-age was 67th percentile and height-for-age was 37th percentile. Body mass index (BMI) was age-appropriate at 72nd percentile. Vital signs, including blood pressure (91/70) and heart rate (71), were age-appropriate. She did not display any dysmorphic features. She had evidence of self-injurious behaviors, including healed scars on her arms and evidence of skin picking on her scalp. She had a healed surgical incision from her VSD repair. She did not display physical findings consistent with fetal alcohol syndrome. Examination of head and neck was unremarkable. Lungs were clear to auscultation. She demonstrated a quiet systolic heart murmur best heard at her left upper sternal border. Her abdomen was soft and non-tender. Cranial nerves were intact. Deep tendon reflexes were symmetric. She demonstrated appropriate bilateral muscle strength and tone. Laboratory values, including complete blood count (CBC) and vitamin D levels, were within normal limits. She had evidence of stage 2 iron deficiency with low ferritin and elevated iron-binding capacity. She was started on an iron supplement. As part of her clinical workup, the patient was evaluated by a genetic counselor, who recommended obtaining a comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray and testing for Fragile X syndrome, given her history of developmental delays and diagnosis of intellectual disability. She was referred to occupational therapy for management of her sensory sensitivities and fine motor delays.\nChromosomal microarray identified a 6.8 Mb deletion at chromosome location 5p15.31-5p15.33 (arr[GRCh37] arr[GRCh37] 5p15.33p15.31(26142_6858476)x1). This area of chromosome 5 is included in the larger deletion associated with Cri-du-chat syndrome. Although smaller than the typical Cri-du-chat deletion, this patient’s deletion was a likely explanation for her history of developmental delays, intellectual disability, and short stature. It may also have contributed to her congenital heart defect. Interestingly, on further discussion with the adoptive mother and review of medical records, it was found that the patient displayed the characteristic high-pitched cry of Cri-du-chat syndrome during infancy. This patient was referred for further evaluation by a medical geneticist and encouraged to contact her biological family to discuss the genetic testing results and whether any further testing of her siblings was warranted. She was formally seen and assessed by a geneticist and genetic counselor. At that time, additional genetic testing through a karyotype was pursued, which was able to rule out the possibility that this terminal deletion was the result of a translocation. That visit was also critical in determining whether any additional testing or healthcare management was indicated based on the genes included in the deleted region, and to discuss implications for inheritance and future childbearing. She was evaluated by Neurology and underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that revealed no intracranial abnormalities other than a presumed incidental cavernoma in the right thalamus that did not correlate with her symptoms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The initial post-transplant course was complicated by fungal sepsis with Candida parapsilosis and a large right atrial thrombus for which she underwent open thrombectomy on cardiopulmonary bypass.\nOn HCT day 60 (), she developed respiratory distress with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography. She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) with worsening hypoxemia progressing to endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Bronchoscopy demonstrated many red blood cells and hemosiderin-laden macrophages consistent with DAH but no active hemorrhage. Bronchoalveolar lavage revealed positive aspergillus antigen, for which she was continued on antifungal therapy for probable pulmonary aspergillosis. She improved with supportive management and was extubated to non-invasive positive pressure support. However, on HCT day 69, she developed new bilateral infiltrates on chest radiography requiring reintubation (). A repeat bronchoscopy showed persistence of hemosiderin-laden macrophages without evidence of active bleeding.\nBy HCT day 76, she progressed to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a peak oxygenation index (OI) of 40. Given her acute deterioration, poor organ reserve, and high mortality risk, she was transferred to the regional pediatric ECMO program at Le Bonheur Children's Hospital and emergently cannulated onto Veno-Venous (VV) ECMO with placement of two-21 French Biomedicus (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) cannulas in the right femoral and right internal jugular veins. She was adequately supported with initial flows of 2.16 liters per minute (LPM), ~40 ml/kg/min, and sweep gas flow of 3 LPM using the Maquet Rotaflow centrifugal pump and Quadrox-iD adult oxygenator (Maquet, Harlingen, Germany). She was anticoagulated on our institution's bleeding protocol with unfractionated heparin targeting an activated clotting time (ACT) of 180–200 s and transfused with packed red blood cells (PRBC) and platelets to keep hematocrit > 35% and platelet count > 75 × 109/L, respectively. She was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day for 7 days followed by a 6 week wean. She was successfully decannulated after 7 days of VV ECMO support. There was no recurrence of pulmonary hemorrhage on ECMO and she was transferred back to the referring institution 3 days after decannulation.\nAfter decannulation, she had multiple pulmonary hemorrhage episodes treated with methylprednisolone, aminocaproic acid, and IP-rFVIIa. A lung biopsy on HCT day 90 was indicative of recent and remote alveolar hemorrhages. Due to her recurrent pulmonary hemorrhages and evolving practice for early tracheostomy placement at that time, her tracheostomy was delayed for more than 60 days following her initial respiratory failure. She was considered a higher risk for early tracheostomy due to secondary graft insufficiency. She received a CD34+ cell boost on HCT day 259. After extensive inpatient rehabilitation, she was liberated from her tracheostomy and is successfully surviving 4 years after HCT.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She was admitted to an inpatient unit for suicidal ideations with a plan. This patient had several previous admissions to inpatient psychiatric centres and was part of an outpatient program for her mental illness. She had a longstanding history of poor social support, difficulties with social communication, and impulsive behaviours. She also had a history of living in a detention centre and foster care during childhood. At the time of admission, she was living with a family friend who served as her caretaker. She reported that her family history was significant for mental illness in several immediate family members but did not specify the disorders they suffered. She denied substance abuse but reported a history of physical and sexual abuse. She also had a history of multiple suicide attempts and self-harming behaviours. Her medication list at the time of admission included perphenazine 4mg daily, microgestin FE 1.5/30 daily, Ventolin inhaler two puffs every 4 hours, Lamotrigine ER 200 mg twice Quetiapine 150mg AM and 300mg HS, and Vistaril 25 mg three times daily. In the past, she had been on Aripiprazole which was stopped due to weight gain. On examination, her mood was irritable, and her affect was constricted. However, she was cooperative throughout the interview. She appeared to have poor social skills, especially with eye contact and social reciprocity. She demonstrated poor insight and judgment. She reported anxiety and agitation. She also reported feelings of hopelessness. She was started on Lurasidone 20mg PO AM and Lithium 150mg twice daily on admission for her mood. She has also prescribed Guanfacine 0.5 mg PO twice daily for impulsivity. Her dose of Lurasidone was increased to 60 mg PO AM daily a week after admission, and her Guanfacine was increased to 0.5mg PO three times daily. She reported that her mood had improved since the admission but reported some gastrointestinal symptoms. Lithium was discontinued to alleviate gastrointestinal distress. She was also given ondansetron 4mg PO every 6 hours for nausea. She displayed gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms and was given Pantoprazole 40mg PO twice daily and Tagamet HB 200mg PO three times daily. She also received a dietary consult due to a history of lactose intolerance. At the beginning of her treatment, the patient was generally withdrawn, often isolating her room and not participating in group activities. She had multiple somatic complaints during her stay, but appropriate workups did not yield any significant findings. As her treatment progressed, she slowly began including herself in group activities and occasionally interacting with peers. Her mood improved after two weeks of treatment. She also showed some improvement in social reciprocity and became less isolative.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She presented with month-long worsening dysphagia, rhinolalia, bilateral ptosis, and skeletal muscle weakness. Signs of muscle fatigability were elicited at the physical exam and then confirmed by electromyography, consistently with neuromuscular junction disease. Blood tests were unremarkable with the exception of acetylcholine receptor antibodies (43 nmol/l, normal if < 0.5 nmol/l). Hence, MG class III, according to the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) scale, was diagnosed [, ]. Partial regression of symptoms to class II MG was achieved by oral administration of pyridostigmine 60 mg every 3 hours during the daytime, pyridostigmine sustained-release 180 mg orally before sleeping, prednisone 25 mg orally each day, and immunoglobulins 0.4 g/kg intravenously for 5 days [, ]. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a 12 cm anterior mediastinal mass suspicious for thymoma, with confirmed infiltration of the anterior chest wall, lung parenchyma, and pericardium at chest magnetic resonance imaging with contrast. CT-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy yielded a histological diagnosis of B2 thymoma []. Due to the young age, a family history of cancer was excluded. Physical exam was negative for signs of mediastinal syndrome and superficial lymph nodes. Metastatic disease was excluded by 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET). Patient imaging is shown in Fig. . Accordingly, the clinical stage was cT3 cN0 cM0 (Masaoka-Koga III) []. After multidisciplinary team discussion, the tumor was defined as unresectable, and the patient was offered primary chemotherapy with intravenous cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 (CAP regimen) on day 1 every 21 days []. Primary prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia was not planned due to the potential risk of worsening MG, without evidence about the safety of administering granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in unstable myasthenic patients []. Ovarian preservation by gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue leuprorelin was preferred over oocyte retrieval to expedite the start of chemotherapy []. Standard pre-medication with intravenous administration of ondansetron 8 mg, dexamethasone 8 mg and saline was chosen [].\nTwo hours after starting administration of the first course of chemotherapy, following doxorubicin bolus, the patient experienced sudden onset of acute dyspnea with severe respiratory failure (oxygen saturation 75% on room air), refractory to oxygen therapy and bolus hydrocortisone 500 mg and chlorphenamine 10 mg administered intravenously []. Physical exam was negative for bronchospasm with diminished vesicular breath sounds. Due to unstable clinical conditions and development of acute respiratory acidosis (pH 7.21, partial pressure of carbon dioxide 88 mmHg), tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU) were needed. Urgent chest CT scan excluded acute cardiopulmonary events. Life-threatening MGFA class V MC was diagnosed, likely triggered by chemotherapy, thus classified as grade 4 according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0) [, ]. Chemotherapy was held for 2 hours and then, considering its curative intent and in agreement with the family, it was resumed and fully administered during mechanical ventilation. After 24 hours, upon remission of MC and weaning from ventilation, the patient was extubated and could continue receiving MG treatment, together with starting PEX once every three days to control MG and prevent new crises (by replacing 1 plasma volume with 5% human albumin) []. In week 2, owing to CTCAE v5.0 grade 3 febrile neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count 60/mm3 and body temperature 38.4 °C), the patient was successfully treated with empirical piperacillin/tazobactam 4 g/0.5 g intravenously every 6 hours until recovery [].\nAfter completing a second course of CAP chemotherapy with interposed PEX allowing symptom control, radiological assessment in week 6 documented objective partial response according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), with 33% tumor shrinkage (maximum diameter 8 versus 12 cm) []. This allowed us to perform radical (R0) extended thymectomy, left upper lung lobectomy and subtotal pericardiectomy, with histological diagnosis of Masaoka-Koga stage III type B2 [, ]. For patient histology, please see Fig. . The patient required early mediastinum and pleural cavity re-exploration due to postsurgical bleeding; persistent hypophonia developed due to postsurgical left vocal cord paralysis. A comparison of CT imaging at baseline and after surgery is shown in Fig. . As suggested for Masaoka-Koga stage III, radiotherapy of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions was given as postoperative treatment in weeks 15–20 []. At the last follow-up visit, 6 months after surgery, the patient was in complete remission with gradually improving MGFA class I MG and mild persistent hypophonia []. Despite remarkable levels of psychological burden, the patient’s resilience and high-priority treatment goals were fundamental for successful coping.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pain was retro-orbital, quantified as 8/10, and worsened with left eye abduction. There was no improvement in pain with warm compresses or acetaminophen. She denied fever, headache, visual changes, eye discharge, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, rash, fatigue, and/or weight loss. Both her family and social history were non-contributory.\nOn physical exam, her temperature was 96.8oF and the remainder of her vital signs were normal for age. Initial ophthalmologic exam demonstrated moderate edema and erythema of the left upper and lower lids, mild proptosis, and pain on left lateral gaze (Figure ). Intraocular pressures and funduscopic exam were normal. Her pupils were both equal and reactive to light and her extraocular movements were intact. She had no sinus tenderness, her oropharynx was clear, her neck supple without masses, and her pulmonary, cardiac, abdominal, neurologic, and dermatologic exams revealed no deficits and/or abnormalities.\nInitial laboratory investigation including complete blood cell count and basic metabolic panel were normal (Table ). Computed tomographic (CT) images with contrast showed inflammation of the medial rectus muscle with evidence of post- and pre-septal edema (Figure ). There was no evidence of abscess or sinus disease. Given the constellation of symptoms and degree of inflammation seen on the CT images, the patient was diagnosed with probable orbital cellulitis. She was started on intravenous vancomycin and ampicillin-sulbactam and admitted to the pediatric hospitalist service for further management.\nThe patient completed over 48 hours of intravenous antibiotics without improvement in eye pain, swelling, or erythema. At this time, magnetic resonance (MR) images showed nonspecific enhancement and enlargement of the left medial rectus muscle without abscess formation. Pediatric rheumatology and infectious disease specialists were consulted and both recommended discontinuing broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics given the lack of both clinical improvement and progression of disease on diagnostic imaging. Additional lab testing was broadly normal (Table ). After a multidisciplinary discussion with infectious diseases, rheumatology, and ophthalmology, a diagnosis of orbital myositis was considered, antibiotics were stopped, and an empiric trial of intravenous methylprednisolone (30mg/kg/dose) was administered. The patient showed dramatic clinical improvement within 24 hours of steroid administration with a significant reduction in her orbital pain, swelling, and erythema. She was subsequently discharged to complete an extended prednisone taper with rheumatology and ophthalmology follow-up. The final diagnosis was determined to be idiopathic orbital inflammation-orbital myositis variant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Serological tests for common infectious agents, including human T-cell lymphotropic viruses I and II; hepatitis A, B, and C viruses; human immunodeficiency viruses 1 and 2; herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2; Epstein–Barr virus; cytomegalovirus; rubella, measles, mumps, and poliomyelitis viruses; as well as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia spp., Yersinia spp., Campylobacter spp., Rickettsia spp., Borrelia spp., pathogens of toxoplasmosis and cryptococcosis, and Coxiella burnetii, were negative. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed a slightly elevated white blood cell count (). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a lesion in the left temporal and right insular lobes (). The patient was diagnosed with viral meningoencephalitis. She recovered with regular acyclovir treatment and was discharged. On September 17, 2016 (at 9 weeks of gestation, as reviewed retrospectively), a subsequent relapse occurred, and the patient presented with headache, nausea, and vomiting. Thus, acyclovir was administered again, and the patient’s condition improved. However, on October 6, 2016, the patient lost consciousness and experienced respiratory failure. She was admitted to an intensive care unit, and based on MRI findings () and CSF analysis (), a diagnosis of ADEM was established. The symptoms presented as alterations in the consciousness levels and behavior that could not be explained by fever, and brain MRI during the acute (3 months) phase indicated abnormalities consistent with demyelination, which supported the diagnosis of ADEM (). In addition, tests for antibodies against proteins associated with demyelination (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, myelin basic protein, and AQP4), oligoclonal bands, autoimmune encephalitis, and paraneoplastic syndrome were negative in both the blood and CSF, which can distinguish ADEM from other demyelinating diseases to some extent. Surprisingly, an intrauterine pregnancy at 12 weeks of gestation was confirmed by abdominal ultrasound. After plasma exchange and gamma globulin (IVIG) therapy, the patient gradually recovered and was able to breathe spontaneously until November 11, 2020. A repeated brain MRI scan showed a significant reduction in the lesion size (). Thereafter, she decided to terminate the pregnancy at 20 weeks of gestation. The abortion occurred on December 1, 2016, and she experienced paroxysmal dizziness and rotation of visual objects for 10 days after the abortion. Multiple new demyelinating-like phenomena were observed by brain MRI () on December 12, 2016, approximately 2 weeks after the abortion. She was again treated with methylprednisolone and IVIG. After a month of rehabilitation training, she was discharged with a better health condition. Lesions in brain stem, bilateral basal ganglia had disappeared which was observed by brain MRI scan at September 8, 2017 during following-up ().

The weakness was preceded by febrile illness one week prior and was sudden in onset and progressed further. She was given a short course of oral steroids elsewhere, with which she had partial relief, but weakness reappeared after stopping the steroids. On admission, she was afebrile. In addition to having proximal myopathy, she admitted to having dysphagia upon deglutition of solid and liquid foods, dysphonia, and dyspnea (single breath count of only 14. There were no cutaneous rashes, fasciculations, tingling/ numbness, with no family history of autoimmune disorders. General physical examination revealed anasarca, while the neurological and sensory studies were normal. At a later stage, she had significant muscle weakness with no muscle wasting. Neurological examination showed intact higher mental function, and gag reflex was absent while the rest of the cranial nerves were normal. The sensory review was within the normal limits with no wasting of muscles. However, there was significant muscle weakness with grade 2/5 power at both the shoulder joints, 3/5 at elbows, wrists, hip joints, knee joints, and 4/5 at the ankle joints. All deep tendon reflexes were present, and there was bilateral plantar flexion.\nThere was no added sound on chest auscultation, and other systems findings were unremarkable. Her biochemical and hematological parameters are shown in Tables , . Viral screening for hepatitis B, C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was negative. Urine analysis revealed mild albuminuria without hematuria and pyuria. Indirect immunofluorescence assay was positive for antinuclear antibodies- human epithelial cells type-2 (ANA HEp2) with nuclear subtle speckled pattern and intensity 4+ (strongly positive) primary titer 1:100 and endpoint titer of 1:3200. Chest x-ray, echocardiogram (ECG), ultrasound abdomen, and pelvis were normal. The nerve conduction study was also normal.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thigh was highly suggestive of myositis with symmetrical bilateral involvement (Figure ). A pulmonary function test revealed a possible severe restriction, but the patient had inadequate respiratory efforts. Hence, we did high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) thorax, which showed no interstitial lung disease evidence. Based on proximal muscle weakness, elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), strongly positive ANA HEp2, and a normal nerve conduction velocity (NCV) with precise MRI findings, a polymyositis diagnosis was made. She was given bolus intravenous methylprednisolone 750 mg/day for five days followed by oral methylprednisolone 16 mg twice a day (0.8 mg/kg) with subcutaneous methotrexate 7.5 mg weekly.\nFollowing this, she had a 50% improvement in muscle weakness; however, partial bulbar weakness persisted at the time of discharge. To that, she was asked to follow-up. When she showed up on the follow-up, her blood investigations for auto-antibodies were done. The autoantibodies anti-Jo-1 (3+), Ro-52 (2+), and Mi-2β (2+) were found to be positive. Based on these investigations conjugated with the presenting clinical features, the diagnostic criteria for polymyositis complicated by antisynthetase syndrome was fulfilled. She was then started on the following drug regimen (Table ).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A contrast MRI with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) of the abdomen revealed marked fusiform dilatation of the extrahepatic CBD measuring 8.8 cm anterior–posterior x 10.9 cm transverse x 12.7 cm craniocaudally, mild-to-moderate central intrahepatic bile duct dilatation and posterior displacement of the patent main portal vein due to associated mass effect (). Based on the image findings the diagnosis of a CC was made. The type, however, could not be definitively diagnosed as the cyst could be a large type I CC with resultant upstream intrahepatic ductal dilatation versus a type IVa CC with associated mild to moderate central intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. Upon review of the images, labs, assessment of the patient, she was scheduled for resection of the extra hepatic bile duct and choledochal cyst with planned Roux en y hepaticojejunostomy.

She had undergone cheiloplasty and palatoplasty at age 3 months and 12 months. In order to improve the facial contour and correct the malocclusion, Le Fort I distraction osteogenesis was performed at our center in July 2019. The distraction lasted for 4 weeks. The A point was moved 13.78 mm anteriorly and 8.56 mm inferiorly after the distraction. Late in the distraction period, the patient progressively experienced a decrease in mandibular mobility. She could open her mouth to about 1 finger without significant joint pain or clicking. CT revealed the left mandibular condyle moving to the inferior aspect of the articular tuberosity (Fig. ). The measurements revealed a 7.74° decrease in saddle angle and a 10.23° increase in articular angle compared to the preoperative period. After distraction, the palatal plane angle increased by 9.30°, the mandibular plane angle increased by 1.93°, the upper gonial angle decreased 5.00°, and a 6.05° increase in the lower gonial angle was observed, indicating an anterior and inferior displacement and a clockwise rotation of both the maxilla and mandible. The dislocated condyle was immediately repositioned by manipulation. The RED device was then removed and internal rigid fixation of the maxilla performed.

Subsequently, she underwent an open feeding jejunostomy (FJ) with the use of Foley’s catheter to give high protein diet to build her for definitive surgical intervention. She presented after one month with failure to gain weight and sudden onset pain in that abdomen for two days.\nUltrasound was done which showed “bowel within bowel appearance” and “target sign” in the right lower quadrant of abdomen around the FJ tube suggesting intussusception (Figure ). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) was requested by the clinician in order to confirm the diagnosis. CECT confirmed the diagnosis of intussusception in the distal bowel. However, it also demonstrated a second intussusception near the entry point of the tube. The distal intussusception was identified secondary to the hyper-inflated bulb of the Foley considered a probable lead point (Figure ). Since the possibility of non-surgical reduction of intussusception was minimal and subsequent bowel ischemia could develop, the patient was taken up for emergent laparotomy.\nIntra-operatively successful reduction of both sites of intussusception was done and the primary cause of distal intussusception was identified to be the hyper-inflated balloon of Foley’s catheter (Figure ). The likely cause of proximal intussusception was the recurrent push of proximal bowel against lax and crumpled distal bowel leading to its invagination. Reinsertion of FJ tube from a different site with Ryle’s tube was done and attached to the anterior abdominal wall.

Pain worsened at physical exertion. The pain was initially treated with anti-inflammatory drugs and analgesics, with a good response for 2 weeks, after which, it became progressively resistant to medication. The patient provided informed written consent that was approved by the IPSPAC Institutional Review Board.\nPatients neurologic evaluation revealed decreased touch and pain perception between the T7 and T11 dermatomes. Reflexes, muscle strength, and laboratory results were normal.\nGadolinium-enhanced spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a solid nodular lesion with heterogeneous post-contrast enhancement and lobulated contours centered on the right foramina of D12–L1, with a projection to the intracanal space, which compressed and laterally displaced the dural sac having a right paravertebral extension between the vertebral bodies of D11 and superior aspect of L2. It measured approximately 5.0 × 3.0 × 9.5 cm (latero-lateral × antero-posterior × caudocranial) (Fig. ). Subsequently, the patient underwent guided biopsy with computed tomography that was histologically described as a focal fusocellular proliferation with dissociating skeletal-muscle fibers (Figs. , ), and the immunohistochemical I19-1289 study confirmed it as a Schwannoma. However, as the MRI and immunohistochemical analysis [that was positive for S100 protein and (SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 10) (SOX-10) antigens] could suggest other diagnoses, we performed a lamina revision in a second pathology laboratory, which confirmed a diagnosis of GN.\nAfter lamina revision, the patient quickly deteriorated with bladder dysfunction and worsening muscle strength on the proximal right lower limb, leading to an expedite surgical intervention conducted by neurosurgery and oncology team.\nSurgical intervention was planned through a combination of two approaches: robot assisted for the anterior/retroperitoneal stage and a posterior hemilaminectomy/microsurgical approach to attempt total resection.\nThe anterior access was performed as a right robot-assisted lateral transabdominal adrenalectomy using the da Vinci® Xi surgical system (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyville, CA, USA). Preoperative preparation, patient positioning, and port-site access followed the lateral transabdominal laparoscopic adrenalectomy protocol. The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and five trocars were inserted: an 8-mm camera port was inserted midway between the umbilicus and the right costal margin 20 cm away from the target; two robotic instrument ports, both 8 mm, were inserted along a line two fingerbreadths 8 cm away from each other over the umbilicus; one robotic instrument 8-mm port was inserted along the same line under the umbilicus at the right iliac pit away from the 8-cm camera port; a 5-mm liver retraction port was inserted in the midline in the epigastrium, and an accessory 10/12 mm auxiliary port was inserted between the camera port and right iliac pit port 7 cm away from each other. The four-step technique of robotic right adrenalectomy was applied []: (1) complete division of the hepatocolic ligament; (2) delineation of the right adreno-caval junction; (3) division of the right adrenal vein; (4) adrenal separation from the kidney, retroperitoneal approach in retrocaval space dissection and identification of the tumor circumferentially. Thus, after first robotic exploration, the triangular ligament was divided via a robotic monopolar hook. The right lobe of the liver was retracted with a laparoscopic retractor (Additional file : Video S1), and the inferior vena cava was exposed after the inferior to superior peritonectomy. The surgeon at the console used the robotic hook for precise dissection of the vena cava along its lateral edge between the inferior vena cava and liver. Landmarks identified included laterally the superior pole of the right kidney and posteriorly the psoas muscle. After careful dissection (Additional file : Video S2), a yellowish, fibroelastic, well encapsulated mass was identified adjacent to the periadrenal space. It lousily adhered to the adjacent structures and could be thoroughly isolated. The surgeon performed the laparoscopic suturing of the diaphragm (Additional file : Video S3) before fully dissect the anterior portion, which was successful until the right limit of the D12 vertebra.\nAfterward the anterior step was performed, the patient was positioned in ventral decubitus position and prepared for a traditional laminectomy. After a dorsolumbar medial incision, a regular bilateral paraspinal muscular dissection was performed. The D11, D12, and L1 lamina, facets, and transverse process were exposed. After performing a D11–L1 hemilaminectomy, the tumor’s origin was identified from the D12 nerve root. The tumor extended from the retroperitoneal space to the spinal canal, entering from the D12–L1 right foramina and compressing the dura mater. Following the reclamation of the D11–D12 zygapophyseal facet and D12 transverse process, the posterior intracanal and paravertebral elements of the mass were removed under microscope visualization. The D12 nerve root had to be severed for total tumor removal; afterward, the retroperitoneal space could be recognized. Postoperative pathologic examination confirmed that it was a GN. Figure demonstrates the patient before and after tumor removal.\nPostoperatively, the patient recovered well. On postoperative day 1, the patient experienced episodes of muscle pain in the abdominal wall and laminectomy region, controlled with analgesics and no further investigation was needed. Patient mobilization occurred on postoperative day 2, when the patient could walk with assistance. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 5. After 1-year of follow-up, the patient had improved muscle strength but still experienced episodes of myofascial pain in the dorsum and on the right lateral abdominal flank, again controlled with analgesics. However, she did not adhere to her physical rehabilitation protocol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She also gave a history of taking analgesics on and off for it. On examination, her vitals were stable and no abnormality was detected on systemic examination. On per-abdominal examination, there was tenderness at the right iliac fossa. She was also advised ultrasonography (USG) to rule out any pelvic pathology. USG suggested differential diagnoses of right-sided hematosalpinx, with hematometra and bicornuate uterus, with non-visualized right kidney. To confirm the diagnosis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, which showed a unicornuate uterus with right-sided functioning cavitary rudimentary horn, right hematometra and hematosalpinx, right ovarian hemorrhagic cyst and right renal agenesis. Intravenous pyelography also confirmed right renal agenesis. On urology consultation, cystoscopy was performed, which revealed non-visualization of the right ureteric orifice with normal left ureteric orifice and bladder mucosa. Even though laparoscopy is the preferred approach in such cases with available facility and expertise, we decided to proceed with laparotomy. On laparotomy, two separate cornu of uterus [] with right-sided hematosalpinx and right ovarian hemorrhagic cyst were seen.

She had tripped over her dog and landed on her left side. NF-1 had been diagnosed clinically in childhood. She had a histologically proven neurofibroma excised from her right forearm four years previously. She had a strong family history of NF-1, her mother and three second degree relatives exhibited clinical features.\nOn examination, we saw that her left leg was shortened, internally rotated, and adducted. There was decreased range of movement. She had diffuse swelling of her left lower limb with a distinct soft tissue mass above her right lateral malleolus. She had six cafβ-au-lait patches on her trunk and bilateral axillary freckling. A radiograph of the pelvis revealed a superior dislocation of her left hip with an abnormal appearing femoral neck (Figure ).\nHer hip was relocated under general anaesthetic and this was maintained with skin traction. A computed tomography (CT) of her pelvis displayed a smooth erosion of the lateral margin of her left ileum and femoral neck, markedly increased femoral neck offset, a concave abnormality superior to the left acetabulum and thinning of the left inferior pubic ramus. These changes, which appeared to be long standing, were accepted to be a result of a local neurofibroma causing bone erosion. Eight days post-operatively she experienced a sudden onset of left hip pain on attempting to move in bed. A radiograph of her hip revealed repeat dislocation. Relocation of her hip was performed under general anaesthetic and balanced skeletal traction was maintained by inserting a pin to her left proximal tibia. Skeletal traction was maintained for six weeks. She was mobilizing without aids at eight weeks and follow-up at three months revealed a normal hip examination.\nShe presented to the orthopaedic clinic six years later complaining of disfiguring hypertrophy of her left lower limb which had worsened markedly over the preceding two years. She was referred to plastic surgeons with a view toward performing a cosmetic debulking procedure. A pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of her lower limb demonstrated soft tissue swelling of her entire lower limb consistent with plexiform neurofibromatosis (Figure ). An MRI of her pelvis displayed a 6 × 4 cm enhancing mass at the superior aspect of the left acetabulum extending into the left hip joint (Figure ). There was smooth erosion of the neck of the femur but the head of the femur appeared to be in joint. An MRI of her lumbar spine was normal. A CT-guided biopsy of this hip lesion histologically confirmed it to be a neurofibroma. CT reconstructions demonstrated no further changes to the bone architecture of her left hip (Figure ). In view of her lack of symptoms and the degree of operative difficulty expected, the peri-articular neurofibroma was not excised. She underwent several debulking procedures of her lower limb with excellent cosmetic results.

The patient had a preconception weight of 300 lbs (preconception BMI of 42 kg/m2). In the late third trimester, she measured 6 cm size greater than dates. Although she “only” gained a total of 25 lbs during her pregnancy, this quantity was considered excessive given her high starting weight. Her 50-gram glucola screen was 110 mg/dl. Her UL-OTD was calculated to be 41 weeks − 12 days = 39 w 2 d (2 days for elevated BMI, 4 days for size > dates, 6 days for excessive weight gain). Due to concerns about the presence of multiple risk factors, and very significant amounts of each risk factor, she was admitted at 38 weeks 3 days gestation for induction of labor for impending CPD.\nOn admission (just after suppertime), her cervical exam revealed 0 cm dilatation, 50% effacement, and −3 station. Her fetus had a vertex presentation. She received a 10-hour course of dinoprostone per vagina (pledget) followed by 8 hours of IV pitocin augmentation. Her cervix appeared unchanged at the end of the first day, and the pitocin was stopped. She had supper and a shower, and a second dose of dinoprostone was placed. Ten hours later, the second dose of dinoprostone was removed, and IV pitocin was restarted. Strong contractions developed by around 10 am. By 11 am, a cervical exam revealed 4 cm dilatation, 80% effacement, and −2 station. Artificial rupture of membranes revealed clear amniotic fluid. An epidural catheter was placed for analgesia. Although some mild variable decelerations were noted, the fetal heart rate demonstrated good general variability. The patient continued to make slow progress. After achieving full cervical dilatation, she pushed for about one hour. With the fetal head on the perineum, several deep variable decelerations were noted. A soft vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery occurred, producing a 7 lb 4 oz infant. A first-degree perineal tear was noted and repaired. Her EBL was 700 cc's, and this excessive loss resulted from the laceration of several labial varicosities. Her baby's APGAR scores were 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes, and it had an unremarkable normal nursery course. Although the patient's postpartum hemoglobin was 8.1 mg/dl, she remained asymptomatic, and both the patient and her infant were discharged to home in good condition on the second postpartum day.\nAgain, we believe that, had the infant been born several weeks later, it would have been 8–12 oz heavier [, ], and the likelihood of an uncomplicated vaginal delivery would have been substantially reduced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Her medical and dental history was evaluated. Dental history revealed that she had received orthodontic treatment for obtaining proper space for prosthetic restoration of her missing lateral incisors. She was wearing Hawley retainer. Periapical and panoramic radiographs and preliminary impression were taken for diagnostic evaluation. A decision was made for dental implant treatment. A maxillary surgical stent was prepared for the correct implant position. The formal surgical procedure recommended by the manufacturer of the dental implant system (XiVE®, DENTSPLY Friadent GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) was followed. At the first stage of surgery, a large fossa and horizontal bone deficiency was observed on the labial alveolar bone. To overcome bone deficiency, small diameter implants were selected and placed with labial angulation to avoid labial fenestration (a 3 × 15 mm XiVE S CELLplusTM, DENTSPLY Friadent GmbH For the left maxillary lateral incisor and a 3 × 13 mm XiVE S CELLplusTM, DENTSPLY Friadent GmbH for the right maxillary lateral incisor) (). The implant shoulder was placed to the 2 mm apical part of the cemento-enamel junction of the neighboring teeth, with the aid of surgical stent. Thereafter, submerged cover screws were fastened, and the flap was precisely repositioned and sutured free of tension. During the healing period, the patient wore an acrylic provisional removable dental prosthesis relieved in the implantation sides. After three months, at the second stage surgery, cover screws were removed, and gingiva formers were located.\nThus, gingival formation was delayed in order to minimize the soft tissue recession. At the fourth month, gingival formers were unscrewed and final impression of the maxillary arch was made using vinyl polysiloxane impression material (Elite HD, Zhermack SpA, Badia Polesine (Rovigo), Italy) while the transfer copings and caps were in place ().\nThe abutment analogs were secured in their places in the impression and the cast was poured in type IV hard plaster (Begostone plus, BEGO Bremer Goldschlagerei Wilh. Herbst GmbH & Co. KG, Bremen, Germany). Abutment selection was performed in the patient’s mouth and on the definitive cast. Standard abutments were excessively in labial position that would not allow proper crown placement. Angled abutments (Dentsply Friadent GmbH) were chosen due to the axial-position problem (orofacial direction) of the implants. However, even angled abutments were insufficient to eliminate excessive labial emergence; therefore, they were prepared using laboratory implant analogs and analog holder to achieve sufficient emergent profile and to optimize place for the ceramic crowns ().\nTemporary crowns were prepared on the master cast using temporary restoration material (Dentalon Plus, Heraeus Kulzer GmbH & Co. KG, Hanau, Germany). Abutments were attached to the implants, screwed onto them and tightened to 35 Nm using ratchet and ratchet hex driver. Temporary crowns were cemented using temporary cement (PreVISION CEM, Heraeus Kulzer GmbH & Co. KG) on abutments for two weeks aiding also for maintaining the tissue form while the permanent crowns were fabricated. Metal ceramic crowns were finished and tried in their places.\nRadiographs were taken at baseline and after 6, 12 and 24 months in order to control the bone level around implants ().\nThe patient was informed on oral hygiene and instructed in the specific care for her new restorations including tooth brushing and flossing. Follow ups were done at monthly intervals for three months, and then once every six months for two years ()",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two years before presentation, she used to have fever in the evening and, gradually, she developed a persistent fever in the last 6 weeks without cough or weight loss.\nShe gave a past history of hypertension, which had been diagnosed when she was eight years old. She was regular antihypertensive medication (amlodepine and aldomet). The dosage of her medications had been decreased gradually by her physician over the last few months and were finally stopped completely based on a belief that her hypertension was spontaneously cured! She also gave a history of abdominal operation at the age of 8 years for a right suprarenal mass after discovering her hypertension, and the histolpathological report revealed fatty tissue changes and not pheochromocytoma, as was believed to be, before the operation. The hypertension was not cured after the operation and the antihypertensive medications were resumed.\nThere was no family history of the same illness or TB in her family members.\nThe patient looks ill, pale, underweight (body weight was 45 kg, height 162 cm and BMI = 17). The right upper limb pulsation was absent while it was normal in the left arm, with high force and volume in both lower limbs. Carotid pulsations were present in both sides. Blood pressure (BP) measurement was taken in the four limbs and was recorded as the following: no BP in the right upper limb, 110/70 mmHg in the left upper limb and 200/130 mmHg in both lower limbs.\nThe neck examination showed a significantly enlarged right cervical lymph node measuring 3.5 cm × 2.8 cm, which was firm, not tender and not fixed to the underlying structures.\nCardiac examination showed normal heart sounds at the apex of the heart with a loud S2 at the base and systolic bruit at the left supraclavicular fossa.

She had an induced abortion done by dilatation and curettage 3 days ago at 13 weeks of gestation (by LMP). It was uncomplicated, and she was asymptomatic till morning, when she woke up in a pool of blood followed by a lower abdominal menstrual-like pain. She denied any history of fever, any systemic illness, any foul smelling vaginal discharge, or any use of medications except prenatal vitamins. Her past medical and surgical history and her family history was not significant, and she denied smoking, use of alcohol or substance abuse.\nPhysical examination showed that she was alert, conscious and cooperative, pale, and hypotensive (BP: 84/60 mm of Hg) with tachycardia (pulse: 112/min) and temperature 98.4 F. Her systemic examination was unremarkable except the tachycardia and tenderness in the suprapubic area. She has no evidence of any respiratory distress or calf tenderness. Per vaginal examination demonstrated enlarged uterus (16-week size) and some amount of tenderness in the fornix.\nResuscitation with intravenous fluids was started immediately at the emergency department, and blood was sent for cross matching and lab works. Packed red blood cells (RBCs) was started as soon as it was available. Transvaginal sonogram done in the emergency department showed enlarged uterus with intrauterine retained products of conception and also a collection in the pouch of Douglas.

On arrival, the patient presented with blurred vision, more specifically progressive loss of vision on the left side upon closing right eye. Of note, the patient's mother had a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia and had experienced a possible CVA at age 33. The patient herself has a history significant for morbid obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and insulin resistance. The patient denied any history of smoking, tobacco, drugs, or alcohol use, as well as any speech abnormalities, dysphagia, tingling, numbness, weakness, bowel or bladder incontinence.\nTwo months prior to admission (PTA), the patient had started taking a third-generation oral contraceptive pill (OCP), norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets, which was stopped 3 weeks later after she developed headaches. One month PTA, the patient developed an “extremely bad” headache, followed by nausea/vomiting, bilateral neck pain, and right ear pain prompting presentation to ED where antibiotics were prescribed for suspected acute otitis media. Two weeks later, the patient returned to the ED with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with bilateral mastoiditis; tympanostomy tubes were placed bilaterally. Symptoms persisted, however, and she subsequently developed blurred vision prompting her return to the ED for a third time, two days later. A head CT scan with contrast demonstrated left jugular venous thrombosis prompting hospital admission. The patient was placed on IV Coumadin, with a Lovenox bridge. She was subsequently discharged on Coumadin (5 mg PO daily) and Lovenox (100 mg subQ BID) and was referred to an ophthalmologist. Six days after hospital discharge, the ophthalmologist noted her to have increased IOP along with papilledema. She was emergently referred to the ED, where a head CT scan demonstrated extension of the thrombotic process to include the dural venous sinus and bilateral jugular veins. These findings prompted the patient's transfer to our care for further evaluation and treatment.\nNeurological evaluation demonstrated papilledema and markedly impaired left eye vision, with no other focal neurological deficits. Coagulation studies demonstrated supratherapeutic anticoagulation levels with PT 33.5, INR 3.6, and APTT 33. Blood work including CBC and electrolytes was normal. Cardiolipin screen and blood cultures (x2) were negative. A hypercoagulability work-up screening for antithrombin III levels, protein C and S, factor VIII, factor V Leiden, lupus anticoagulant, prothrombin G210A mutation, and homocysteine returned unremarkable. MRI of the brain with and without contrast revealed no evidence of an acute ischemic event but did show evidence of dural and cortical venous thrombosis and findings consistent with mastoiditis (see ). MR venography (MRV) of the head without contrast demonstrated DST with areas of apparent collateralization and recanalization (see ).\nInterventional radiology was consulted for mechanical thrombectomy and thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), both of which were successfully performed. Ophthalmological evaluation after the procedure demonstrated no afferent papillary defect, clearing of papilledema, and decreased visual acuity bilaterally with left eye 20/100 and right eye 20/200. Follow-up CT cerebral angiography revealed improvement in the appearance of both transverse venous sinuses and the superior sagittal sinus when compared to previous images.

Clinically, bilateral enlargement of the face, mouth opening limited to approximately 2.0 cm, and bilateral eversion of lower vestibule were detected. The total eruption of the right lower third molar, the partial eruption of the left lower third molar, and total eruption of the upper left and right third molars were evidenced. The oral mucosa of the patient at these regions showed normal aspects.\nThe 3D reconstruction at the CT scan views, showed a thin and/or eroded area in the vestibular and lingual cortical bones of the retromolar region, exhibiting multiple deep depressions, occurring mainly and more extensive on the right than on the left side. However, there was an absence of the lesion bone in the condyle processes, and the cortical bone of the mandibular basis showed normal features (). The axial CT scan and the panoramic radiograph showed large and a soap bubble-like cavities at the angle and ramus of the mandible, as well as thin or disrupted vestibular mandibular cortical bone (Figures and ). This lesion spread from the premolar toward the coronoid process in the right and from the molar toward the coronoid process in the left side. Moreover, there were no signs of the lesion in the maxilla, and the lower second molars remained surrounded by the lesion.\nThe results of the laboratory tests were within normal limits for alkaline phosphatase (20 lU l-I; normal: adults 13–43 lU l-I, child 56–156 lU l-I), calcium (8.6 mg dI-I; normal: 8.8–11.0 mg dl-1), phosphorus (4.1 mg dI-I; normal: adult 2.5–4.8 mg dI-I, child 3–7 mg dI-I), and parathyroid hormone levels (21.30 pg ml-I; normal: 13–54 pg ml-I).\nAn incisional biopsy in the left mandibular area of the lesion was performed, and histological sections showed connective tissue looser and fewer multinucleated giant cells than the first histological examination done. Discrete number of blood vessels, various bone trabeculae, and osteoid tissue were also present (Figures and ). The clinical, radiographic, laboratory, and microscopic features of the lesion suggested a diagnosis of diagnosis of Agressive Cherubism.\nThe preconized treatment was partial curettage of the lesion, because the total removal could result pathological fractures and some bone cavities did not present surgical access. The multilocular cavities without lesion were totally filled by autogenous cancellous bone and bone marrow grafts (Figures and ), obtained from the patient's iliac crest. The supported therapy in the postoperative was the administration of antibiotic Cefadroxil monohydrate 500 mg capsules (Cefamox, Bristol-Myers Squibb, São Paulo, Brazil), during ten days. Immediately after the surgical procedure, the patient was prescribed a systemic treatment using daily calcitonin in the form of salmon calcitonin nasal spray (Miacalcic, Norvatis AG, Switzerland), alternating the nostrils, in the dosage of 200 UI during the first year postoperative.\nAfter surgical procedure, the patient was submitted to radiographic examinations annually until the remission of the lesion.\nAfter surgery, the laboratorial results remained normal to calcium (10.4 mg dl−1), phosphorus (4.1 mg dl−1), parathormone levels (22.9 pg mg−1), and calcitonin (2.0 pg mg−1; normal/women: <5.0 pg mg−1); however, there was an increase in the alkaline phosphatase (54 IU l−1), probably due to progressive bone formation process.\nThe patient presented an expressive Postoperatory improvement, which was preserved during all annual follow-up assessments. These periodicals controls will be done until the remission of the lesion. If the lesions do not go into a complete spontaneous remission, a complementary surgery could be performed.\nA future appointment will be scheduled for the extraction of the remaining unerupted teeth in order to avoid further development of cyst and/or odontogenic tumors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor recurrence was noted six months later in both lungs for which she received additional chemotherapy and bilateral lung radiotherapy. Between ages 15 and 17 years, she experienced several bouts of recurrent disease in the right chest treated by stem cell transplant, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. A severe septic complication developing after the stem cell transplant required 12 weeks of intensive care.\nThoracic Surgery service was consulted for management of disabling persistent right posterior chest wall pain due to multiple pleural-based tumor recurrence in the paravertebral gutter and lung parenchyma (). The goals of surgical treatment were disease control and palliation. Right thoracotomy was performed, and complete resection was carried out by extrapleural and intrapericardial pneumonectomy. Intraoperatively, a CSF leak was recognized and treated with a free muscle plug patch inserted in the aperture of the intervertebral foramen and reinforced with Tissel glue (Baxter Biosurgery, Deerfield, Il).\nIn the early postoperative period, serial chest radiographs failed to demonstrate the expected mediastinal shift to the right hemithorax (Figures and ). This prompted early investigation with a CT myelogram that confirmed a suspected SPF at the right T4/5 intervertebral foramen (Figures and ). She was immediately referred for definitive neurosurgical care involving unilateral T4 and T5 laminectomy that revealed CSF leaking from an avulsed nerve root on the lateral aspect of the dural sac. A nonabsorbable, 6-0 prolene, continuous suture from caudal to cephalad was used to close this 7 mm defect. The integrity of the repair was confirmed by a Valsalva maneuver during which no CSF was observed to leak. The suture line was reinforced with a 2 mm layer of fibrin sealant.\nThe patient's postoperative course was significant only for the development of pneumonia for which she received in-patient treatment.

An examination revealed a firm, non-tender swelling in the right submandibular region measuring 3 cm × 3 cm (Figure ). Computed tomographic (CT) scan findings were a minimally enhancing, hypodense lesion measuring 4.5 cm × 3.7 cm × 2.6 cm within the right submandibular salivary gland, with an enhancing rim of the normal submandibular gland at the periphery (Figure ). The CT scan revealed no evidence of the mass lesion elsewhere in the head and neck region. Fine-needle aspiration was done, which showed moderately cellular smears composed of cells arranged in loose clusters and sheets showing a whorling pattern in places. Individual cells were polygonal to spindle-shaped with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. The nuclei were round to ovoid and regular with finely granular, evenly distributed chromatin. Few cells showed intra-nuclear cytoplasmic inclusion (Figure ). On the basis of these findings, a diagnosis of right submandibular gland neoplastic lesion, suggestive of oncocytoma, was made. The possibility of a primary ectopic meningioma was also considered on the basis of the findings of the whorling arrangement of cells and intra-nuclear inclusion. Intra-operatively, the submandibular salivary gland could be dissected separately, and the well-circumscribed tumor was seen in the vicinity of the deep lobe of the gland, which was surgically excised. Grossly, two tissue masses were removed. The larger mass was smooth, firm, well circumscribed and oblong, measuring 3 cm × 3 cm × 2 cm. The cut surface was grayish white with few areas of congestion. The smaller mass was a salivary gland. The cut surface of the gland appeared unremarkable. Multiple sections were taken from the tumor. Histologically, the lesion was characterized by a lobular architecture and showed uniform spindle-cell proliferation separated by hyalinized collagen bundles. The cells were arranged in short fascicles, in concentric whorls and, in places, in a typical meningothelial pattern (Figure ). The neoplastic cells had abundant, lightly eosinophilic cytoplasm, indistinct cytoplasmic borders and round or oval nuclei with finely dispersed chromatin and indistinct nucleoli.

After collapsing on train, she was admitted to local hospital where she was diagnosed of cardiogenic shock with echocardiogram showing severely impaired left ventricular function with ejection fraction of 20%. She was started on Dobutamine and transferred to our institution for further management. On arrival, the systolic blood pressure was 54 mmHg, sinus tachycardia of 130 per minute, tachypnea and the lactate of 13 mmol/l. The air entry was good and there were no added sounds on auscultation. She arrested shortly after arrival, was intubated and ventilated and after 65 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) a Veno - Arterial Extra corporal membrane oxygenator (VA ECMO) was inserted. The decision to put ECMO was based on need of short term circulatory support and emergency situation. The option of short term left ventricular assist device (LVAD) was not feasible as patient was being resuscitated and could not be moved in theatre for LVAD implantation. The left femoral vessels accessed percutaneously by Seldinger technique. A 17 and 21 French cannulae were inserted into Femoral artery and vein respectively and connected to ECMO circuit comprising Levitronic CentriMag pump and Medtronic oxygenator. A 10 French cannula was inserted in Femoral artery for distal limb perfusion and connected to the main arterial cannula by 'Y' connection. Cardiovascular stability could be achieved with initial ECMO flow of 3 l/min and moderate doses of Noradrenalin and Adrenaline targeting a mean arterial pressure of 60 mmHg. Due to the cardiogenic shock and the hypotension caused by the low cardiac output state she developed acute kidney injury and was treated with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). On day 3, she developed compartment syndrome in the leg on the side of ECMO insertion which needed fasciotomy. Viral PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test detected Influenza A RNA in nasal and throat secretions of the patient confirming H1N1 Pandemic strain a week after the admission and she was started on OD 5 mg Oseltamivir. After 10 days of mechanical support, left ventricular function improved significantly and ejection fraction of 50-55% with the ECMO flows turned down to minimal. The ECMO was weaned off but the ischemic left leg continued to deteriorate despite fasciotomy and revision surgery and left above knee amputation had to be performed. Patient was found intact neurologically from the 4th day of ECMO insertion but kept sedated electively till ECMO was out. Weaning from ventilator and CVVH was unremarkable. Follow up investigations with MRI showed an EF 72%, normal volume and thickness of the ventricle and no regional wall motion abnormalities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She was admitted to a local hospital a few hours after ingestion and was transferred to a teaching hospital in Ragama, where she developed a generalized tonic clonic seizure that lasted five minutes. When she was admitted to the teaching hospital, her capillary blood sugar level had been 42 mg/dL and was treated with a bolus intravenous dextrose and 10% dextrose infusion. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed a severe metabolic acidosis (Table ). She was treated with two doses of 75 mL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) (75 mmol) but had persisting acidosis three hours later. At that stage, she was given 50 mL of NaHCO3 (50 mmol), 500 mg ampicillin, and 50 mg ranitidine (all intravenously) and was transferred to a Tertiary care hospital, Colombo (THC) for hemodialysis.\nAt THC, she complained of burning epigastric pain and shortness of breath. She also had several episodes of vomiting. Her peripheries were warm. She had Kussmaul breathing and a respiratory rate of 44/minute, a pulse rate of 116/minute, and a blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg. Except for the mild epigastric tenderness, the results of the rest of a physical examination were normal. Her oxygen saturation was 92% with 5 L/minute oxygen via a face mask. The ABG at 15 hours after ingestion showed continuing acidosis with a high anion gap (Table ). Her serum lactate level was elevated at 59.96 mg/dL.\nEighteen hours after ingestion, she was started on intermittent hemodialysis with bicarbonate buffer (which contains both solutions A and B) (Additional file ). The initial dialysis was continued only for two and a half hours with a blood flow rate of 140 mL/minute and a dialysate flow rate of 500 mL/minute. However, she continued to be acidotic four hours after the dialysis (that is, 28 hours after ingestion). She was treated again with 8.4% NaHCO3 (100 mL), and dialysis was repeated on the following day. The ABG after the second dialysis (that is, 48 hours following ingestion) showed compensated metabolic acidosis (Table ). The serum creatinine level was 279 μmol/L on admission and started to increase rapidly two days after admission (Figure ) and was accompanied by a declining urine output. Subsequently, she was dialyzed on days 3, 10, and 14. All of the subsequent dialyses were continued for 4 hours with a blood flow rate of 200 mL/minute and a dialysate flow rate of 500 mL/minute. Her urine output and renal functions improved gradually, and after three weeks she was discharged with normalized renal functions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She was unmarried and had regular menstrual cycles. She weighed 54 kgs and was 157 cms tall. Her body mass index was 22 kg/m2. General physical examination revealed multiple soft subcutaneous swellings over her hand, knuckles, achilles tendon, wrist and ankle suggestive of xanthomas (Figure ). She had corneal arcus (Figure ). Her systems exam revealed tachycardia, S3 gallop on cardiac auscultation and bibasilar crackles in the lungs. Electrocardiogram was consistent with acute anterior wall myocardial infarction. Echocardiogram showed a hypokinetic anterior wall of the heart, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%, aortic valves were normal with no evidence of valvular stenosis. She was consequently thrombolysed with tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) for her acute anterior wall myocardial infarction and her pulmonary edema was managed. Her labs revealed normal blood counts and renal functions. Her fasting lipid profile (table ) showed a high total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol with normal triglycerides. Her angiogram showed 60% stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery and a 30% stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery. The biopsy of one of the swellings (the swelling in her wrist) revealed lipid laden foam cells with large areas of cholesterol clefts (figure ), suggestive of a xanthoma. On further questioning she gave a family history of accelerated atherosclerosis. Her mother and her maternal uncle had died due to myocardial infarction at the age of 23 years and 19 yrs respectively and that her mother also had similar xanthomas. Her only sibling her younger sister (15 yrs old) in addition to having xanthomas, had a lipid profile (Table ) consistent with a high total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol with normal triglycerides. Her pedigree chart can be seen in Figure .\nShe was initially treated with atorvastatin 80 mg once daily with ezetimibe 10 mg daily. Her LDL-C levels measured after 8 weeks was still 538 mg/dl (table ). Hence in view of persistent LDL-C elevation inspite of maximal drug therapy for 8 weeks, the patient was advised LDL apheresis and was referred to a specialist center. On follow up, after 3 sessions of LDL apheresis (one session every week), her LDL-C levels were 165 mg/dl (table ).

There was no vaginal itching or burning.\nTotal IgE was slightly elevated, 350 (0–250) KIU/L. The Phadia Immunocap and the Multiple Allergen Simultaneous Test-chemiluminescent Assay (MAST CLA) test panels were negative []. Histamine release tests for latex, the partners saliva, sweat and semen were performed. The histamine release test procedure includes histamine release from peripheral whole-blood basophils, in a glass fiber prepared microtiter plate, by challenging 25 μL heparinised whole blood with 25 μL buffered allergen dilutions in various concentrations for 60 minutes at 37°C. The assay is calibrated by a two-point standard curve and a positive cell control (anti-IgE) []. The test results are given as negative or positive. Histamine release tests for latex and for the partners saliva and sweat were negative, whereas the test was positive for the partners semen. The partners sweat, saliva, and semen were also tested in blood from a healthy control person, and these tests were all negative. Furthermore, a skin prick test was performed in the patient finding a positive reaction with a diameter of 12 (positive control 5) mm for the partners semen. Skin prick tests with the partners semen were also performed in two healthy women finding negative results.\nDuring the first 6 months after a diagnosis of anaphylaxis to human seminal plasma was established, condom usage was not sufficient for prophylaxis. Even close body contact such as kissing and hugging would cause acute urticaria, sneezing, and conjunctivitis despite daily intake of oral antihistamines, however, life-threatening anaphylactic reactions did not occur. Sexual intercourse was only possible on prednisolone 25 mg/day; so, the couple opted for abstinence and slept in separate rooms during most of that period. Between 6 and 12 months after the diagnosis was established, gradually, body contact became possible, and some months later with the use of a condom and on premedication with oral antihistamines coitus was possible without associated symptoms. During the second and third years after diagnosis the patient would still use oral antihistamines prior to intercourse several times per week; however, the condition was challenged on a regular basis by the couple showing milder and milder symptoms. Five years after the diagnosis incidental episodes of provocation caused by condom defects and intended challenges without condom were not associated with significant symptoms. A skin prick test in the patient for the partners semen at that time found a positive reaction of a diameter of 10 (positive control 7) mm.

She was born in Jamaica and had moved to The Netherlands eight months prior to presentation. She had no relevant medical history and did not use any medication. On physical examination, we found her fingers to be cramped with Trousseau's sign positive. No other abnormalities were observed. Laboratory analysis showed severe hypocalcaemia (1.17 mmol/L; reference value 2.10–2.50) and hyperphosphataemia (2.0 mmol/L; 0.7–1.4) with normal blood levels of albumin (36 g/L; 35–50), creatinin (61 μmol/L; 50–90), and alkaline phosphatase (96 U/L; 0–120). Magnesium was slightly decreased (0.6 mmol/L; 0.7–1.0). Electrocardiography showed normal QTc time, but flattened ST segments, consistent with hypocalcaemia.\nAs could be expected in a dark-skinned person in Dutch autumn, the 25OHD level was low (31 nmol/L; 50–280). However, this minor deficiency was an unlikely explanation for the severe calcium depletion. 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D was low normal (69 pmol/L; 48–161). Instead, the combination of hypocalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia was considered more consistent with hypoparathyroidism, a diagnosis supported by urine analysis, showing a low excretion of both calcium (0.8 mmol/day; 2.5–7.5) and phosphate (5 mmol/day; 10–50). Unexpectedly, parathyroid hormone (PTH) was increased (22.1 pmol/L; 1.3–6.9), rendering the possibility of pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP). To confirm this diagnosis, an Ellsworth-Howard test was performed, measuring urinary phosphate excretion after administration of a high dose of synthetic PTH. In our patient, phosphate excretion only increased fivefold, where a 100-fold increase is regarded as normal, supporting the diagnosis PHP. No other hormonal imbalances were found. Although the normal alkaline phosphatase level suggested no PTH-induced increase in bone resorption, densitometry was performed to assess bone mineral density, revealing normal values of the lumbar spine (T = +0.2) and hips (T = +1.4).\nUpon treatment with calcium supplementation and 1α-(OH)-vitamin D (alfacalcidol), symptoms disappeared.

She had been born with no complications at 40-weeks gestation by spontaneous vaginal delivery. The pregnancy was uneventful. At two weeks of age, she had an apneic attack at home, possibly due to choking, and was resuscitated by the ambulance service after 10 minutes of cyanosis. Subsequently, she developed “congenital” nystagmus and maintained good health. She wore glasses for astigmatism. She was studying in mainstream school with the use of magnifiers, as she was having difficulty reading. At secondary school, she was given additional educational support on account of her visual difficulties. Her difficulties not only related to vision but also to her interpretation of the visual environment and this caused embarrassment and lack of confidence.\nOn examination, her visual acuities were right eye 20/80 and left eye 20/60, and 20/40 binocularly for single letters (Snellen's test type). For crowded letters, her binocular visual acuity was 20/80 and N18 for reading material. Extraocular movements were full. There was uniplanar (horizontal) manifest nystagmus with a diminished amplitude (or null point) on slight left gaze. Examination of the eyes was normal. Visual field examination proved difficult unless the patient was prompted, because peripheral visual inattention was evident. No colour vision deficit was identified.\nHer mother described that, as a child, the patient bumped into obstacles and was not able to judge when the pavement ended and the road began. She was unable to identify distant targets. She did not like it when the furniture in the house was moved, as she then bumped into it. She had problems finding objects on a patterned background, that is, she could rarely find her clothes on a patterned bedspread. She hated shopping as she could not cope with the crowds. She explained that it was difficult to recognize faces, especially when concentrating on other things. She found it very difficult to identify the family car from among other parked cars. (a) summarizes the features elicited.\nBinocular VEP to reversing black and white checkerboards (120′ element size) showed delayed P100 recordings (150 ms; upper limit of normal 110 ms). Monocular pattern-onset VEPs showed delayed C1 at 160 ms and 164 ms for the right and left eyes, respectively (upper limit of normal 115 ms). The hemispheric VEP distribution was in keeping with normal chiasmal crossing. Binocular ERGs were normal for photopic and scotopic conditions. These findings render albinism or retinal disorders very unlikely as causes of her nystagmus.\nMRI of the brain showed major structures to be present and intact (). The optic nerves, chiasm, and optic tracts showed no abnormality. The corpus callosum and posterior pituitary gland were normal. There was no significant ventricular dilation or asymmetry in the posterior horns of the lateral ventricles and no gross asymmetry of the cerebral hemispheres. The white matter thickness around this region was normal but the grey matter thickness in both occipital poles was diminished and poorly defined, consistent with a cortical atrophy. Brain folding and myelination, apart from the occipital poles, were normal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She was pregnant although she could not state precisely when her last menstrual period had taken place and had not yet begun her prenatal care. She denied complaints of fever, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, urinary symptoms and vaginal bleeding or discharge. However, she had a history of mild chronic constipation since childhood, with sporadic use of laxatives, which had never been investigated.\nUpon physical examination, our patient was hydrated, well-nourished, had a normal blood pressure and heart rate, and had no respiratory distress. On gynecological examination, it was impossible to insert the speculum and bimanual palpation revealed a large abdominal mass of hard consistency extending from her right iliac fossa to her right upper quadrant, apparently displacing our patient’s uterus to the left. A large quantity of impacted stools was found within her rectum and anal verge.\nA pelvic ultrasound revealed a single in uterus pregnancy of twelve weeks and six days (by biometric measures) and a solid dense tumor occupying the right quadrants of her abdomen, which made it difficult to correctly assess her ovaries.\nTo classify the nature of the tumor, we performed abdominal and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) because this is considered to be a safe imaging study with regards fetal exposure to radiation. The MRI demonstrated a large abdominal and pelvic mass consistent with a megarectum and megasigmoid (Figures ), with fecal impaction, which exerted a mass effect over the adjacent structures, including her uterus. Her kidneys were normal and there was no free liquid in her abdominal cavity.\nRoutine laboratory blood tests were unremarkable. Her thyroid function was normal, and her results were negative for toxoplasma, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus infection and for tumor markers (α-fetal protein, carbohydrate antigen 125 and carcinoembryonic antigen).\nAfter discussing the case in a multidisciplinary meeting (with Gastroenterology, General Surgery and Radiology) and considering the mild nature of our patient’s constipation, we decided to manage her megacolon during pregnancy with medical treatment alone. An osmotic laxative (magnesium hydroxide) was begun. A monthly prenatal appointment was planned to evaluate maternal complaints and weight gain as well as to monitor fetal development.\nDuring pregnancy, our patient maintained mild constipation interspersed with short periods of diarrhea. She was admitted to our hospital in the 28th week for profuse diarrhea with no clinical or laboratory signs of infection and was discharged 24 hours later. The remainder of her pregnancy occurred with no other gastroenterological or obstetric incidents, including obstructive symptoms, with normal maternal weight gain and fetal development.\nAt 39 weeks of gestation, our patient returned to our hospital complaining of colicky abdominal pain. A nonstress test did not reveal any signs of fetal distress and showed an irregular pattern of uterine contractions. On vaginal examination, the fetal head was engaged but it was not possible to evaluate the uterine cervix because of a solid mass of impacted stools that was obstructing the pelvic outlet. A manual disimpaction was accomplished under intermittent fetal monitoring, but during the procedure a sudden continuous fetal bradycardia was detected. This required an emergency Cesarean section under general anesthesia, which occurred with no intraoperative complications. Eleven minutes later, a female neonate weighing 2900g was delivered, with a one-minute Apgar score of three and a five-minute score of five. Neonatal resuscitation was required. There were no anatomic abnormalities of the umbilical cord and placenta and a normal cord insertion to the placenta was present. The newborn baby was admitted to our Neonatal Intensive Unit Care until the 26th day of life for neonatal asphyxia, metabolic acidosis and seizures. A cerebral MRI revealed severe hypoxic–ischemic lesions and after discharge, the baby was referred to a cerebral palsy specialized center.\nAfter delivery, the mother had a rapid recovery with reestablishment of normal bowel function 24 hours after the surgery. After being discharged, she started attending regular gastroenterological appointments. She maintained mild constipation that was easily controlled with magnesium hydroxide, but one year after delivery she attended our hospital with chronic constipation unresponsive to medical therapy. An MRI performed at that time revealed persistent dilatation of her colon and we decided to perform a rectosigmoid resection, which occurred without complications. A histopathological analysis revealed a significant reduction of nerve cells in the myenteric and submucous plexus and hypertrophy of the muscularis mucosa (Figures ). The acetylcholinesterase activity was not evaluated because this test is not available in our institution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She had uncontrollable vomiting after meals, loss of weight, and hypokalemia. Whilst she wanted to gain weight, she was unable to do so. Her vomiting had started four years earlier, and a gastroscopy, performed abroad, was found to be normal. The eating disorder was thought to be precipitated by feeling fat as a child and bullying by her mother for being overweight. Her mother and father had split up soon after the eating disorder was diagnosed.\nWhilst at the psychiatric unit, her weight was 32.9 kg, height was 1.57 m, and body mass index (BMI) was 13.3. During the two months of admission in the psychiatric unit for assessment and treatment, there had been attempts to pass a nasogastric tube, but these had failed due to difficult placement. She developed a chest infection, which was treated by antibiotics, but the report of the chest X-ray raised the possibility of an oesophageal pouch. This was followed up by a barium swallow, which revealed a mega oesophagus, which tapered towards the gastro-oesophageal junction, consistent with a radiological diagnosis of established achalasia.\nShe was subsequently transferred to an upper gastrointestinal surgeon for further investigations, and gastroscopy showed a narrowing at the gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ), which was not possible to traverse.\nAt this time, with a BMI of only 13.3, any further interventional treatment options, such as oesophageal dilatation or Heller myotomy, would carry a considerable morbidity/mortality in the event of any complications, due to her profound malnourished state. It was decided to place a feeding jejunostomy, inserted via a laparoscopic-assisted technique. Two months after feeding, a further gastroscopy was attempted, the stricture at the GOJ was negotiated, a balloon dilatation was performed, and biopsies were taken. Histology showed low-grade oesophagitis and no evidence of malignancy. It was our intention to perform manometry studies to confirm the diagnosis, but this failed due to inability to pass the manometry probe past the stricture. After 2 months of HEN, she was reviewed in clinic where weight gain had been sufficient and had risen to 46 kg (BMI 18.7). She was still vomiting after meal but was continuing with the jejunal feeding in the nighttime. At this point, it was felt safe enough to proceed to LHM. The patient made an uneventful recovery and was able to eat and drink normally without any vomiting. Feeding jejunostomy was removed, and the patient's weight stabilised to give a BMI of 22, and she went through delayed puberty.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cephalometric analysis revealed a clockwise rotation of the mandible as well as a regular palatal plane angle.\nInitially, only the upper first molars were intruded (Figure\n). After five months of treatment, when a vertical distance between upper and lower first molars became visible, brackets were bonded to the maxillary second bicuspids and second molars and short wire segments (.012” NiTi) were inserted.

She also complained of recurrent episodes of right eye superior quadrantanopia. Her past medical history included a mitral valve prolapse.\nOn admission physical examination of the patient was febrile with a body temperature of 37.9°C, her blood pressure was 105/80 mmHg, with a pulse rate of 108 beats/min, respiratory rate was 16/min, and oxygen saturation was 98.8%. On cardiac auscultation a midsystolic click a holosystolic murmur grade 3/6 with a maximum at the apex and radiating to the axillawas heard. There were no signs of heart failure. Examination of the respiratory system and the abdomen was normal, and there were no neurological abnormalities\nThere were no peripheral stigmata of endocarditis: no evidence of splinter or subungual hemorrhages, of Osler nodes and petechiae, and no hepatosplenomegaly.\nThe patient was sent to cardiology consultation from the ER and echocardiogram was performed, which showed thickened mitral leaflets and confirmed a mild mitral valve prolapse with mild regurgitation on Doppler.\nOn admission hematological variables were abnormal showing anemia (hemoglobin level was 10.3 g/dL with normal chromic normal cystic red blood cell indices), a low serum iron level and high serum ferritin level, and leukocytosis with increased neutrophil count. Kidney function variables were normal, and serum troponin T was negative. Total bilirubin was 0.6 mg/dL, and transaminases were also normal. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 33 mm in the first hour, the C-reactive protein was elevated (CRP) (14 mg/dL), circulating immune complexes (CIC) were also assayed but these were normal, whereas rheumatoid factor and gamma-immunoglobulins were elevated. The urinalysis revealed proteinuria and microscopic hematuria. In view of anamnesis mitral valve prolapse and the detection of heart systolic murmur and fever, repeated blood cultures were taken, and transthoracic echocardiogram was repeated.\nThe transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a large vegetation on the anterior mitral valve leaflet flopping from the atrial side to the ventricular side. The vegetation measured 1.03 × 1.66 cm. The patient had moderate mitral regurgitation (see ).\nPending the report of blood cultures the patient was initially treated empirically with intravenous administration of some antibiotics.\nFive sets of blood cultures were positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci. It was negative on tube coagulase testing but pyrrolidonyl arylamidase, ornithine decarboxylase, and fermentation positive, so Staphylococcus lugdunensis was definitively identified by the API ID32 staphylococcus, bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile. Susceptibility to antimicrobial agents was determined by a disk diffusion method and confirmed by a broth microdilution method, and organism was susceptible to several antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, erythromycin, vancomycin, penicillin G, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, daptomycin, gentamicin, and clindamycin). On the basis of positive blood cultures (>2) and echocardiograph finding, according to the modified Duke criteria [], it was possible to diagnose acute infective endocarditis, and therefore the antibiotic therapy was changed; the patient began therapy with oxacillin (3 g every 6 h iv) + gentamicin (3 mg/kg for 24 h in three doses every 8 hours) as in the latest indication of the scientific literature in the treatment of endocarditis caused by staphylococci in native valves [, ]. The patient remained under observation.\nA few days later no improvement was observed (patient still had a fever and the inflammatory markers persisted although slightly reduced: CRP: 7 mg/dL; GB: 12.200 N: 77% 1; ESR: 29 mm/1 h), so a new echocardiograph assessment was performed which showed unchanged vegetation size and a progression from mild to moderate mitral regurgitation at Doppler.\nIn relation to both the evidence in the scientific literature of the high risk cardioembolic and destructiveness of endocarditis due to this causative agent and with our diagnostic hypothesis that anamnesis episodes of quadrantanopia were clinical manifestations suggestive of retinal embolism, heart surgery counseling was required, but it did not pose an indication for eventual surgery so the antibiotic therapy already set was continued.\nBlood cultures, undertaken in the following days, confirmed the persistent state of sepsis by Staphylococcus lugdunensis (with the same antibiotic sensitivity profile); laboratory parameters showed no improvement.\nDuring hospitalization, after two weeks of antibiotic therapy, the patient complained of sudden pain in her right leg associated with numbness; at observation of the lower limb (foot and leg to the upper third) pale skin color with marble foot were observed, absence of posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arterial pulse, and cool to the touch. So the patient underwent urgent lower limb arterial Doppler ultrasound which showed demodulation flow at the origin of the right common iliac artery, suggestive of total arterial thrombosis. Transfemoral iliac embolectomy was promptly performed and on septic embolus (see ) S. lugdunensis, with the same antibiotic sensitivity and the same MIC values, was again isolated.\nThe clinical picture required a new heart surgery consultation, and emergency surgery was performed. The patient underwent cardiac surgery: triangular resection of the A2 with removal of infected tissue including vegetation, reconstruction of the valve leaflet, and then positioning a pair of Gore-Tex artificial chords to support A2; posterior annuloplasty by implantation of Duran band 25 mm was also performed.\nIn the postoperative heart surgery the patient has followed an intensive program of physical and respiratory rehabilitation with excellent recovery. At one-year follow-up our patient is well.\nS. lugdunensis is, commonly, a constituent of the human normal skin flora, preferentially colonizing the perineal region, and an infrequent, but not rare, human pathogen, and a rare contaminant in culture. Although CNS were historically considered innocuous or, rarely, opportunistic pathogens of low virulence, which have a major role in nosocomial infections [], S. lugdunensis behaves more like S. aureus, exhibiting an elevated degree of virulence [, ].\nThe organism occasionally causes serious invasive infections such as osteomyelitis, septic arthritis in a native joint, prosthetic joint infections, spondylodiscitis, cellulitis, urinary tract infections, peritonitis, soft tissue abscesses or wounds, brain abscess, meningitis, ventriculitis, ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection, endometritis, infective endocarditis (native valve endocarditis and prosthetic valve endocarditis), myocarditis, pacemaker-related endocarditis, toxic shock syndrome, and septic shock [, ].\nThe majority of cases of IE caused by S. lugdunensis involve native valves, whereas other coagulase negative staphylococci (mainly S. epidermidis) infect the prosthetic valve. Mitral and aortic valve infection is often reported, and in some cases there is multivalvar endocarditis [].\nMost strains are penicillin and methicillin-susceptible but, despite the sensitivity of the organism in vitro, medical therapy is rarely successful, so most patients need surgery during the active phase of the disease. The first documented case of endocarditis caused by S. lugdunensis dates back to 1988, and not many case reports have since been published, almost all of which demonstrate the poor outcome of endocarditis caused by this aggressive organism except in cases of early heart surgery.\nLiu et al. [] have recently published a systematic Medline review (from January 1988 up to June 2008; 67 cases of S. lugdunensis IE) from which 67.2% cases of IE were community-acquired with an unknown portal of entry; 65.5% had comorbidities; native valve, prosthetic valve, and pacemaker IE accounted for 80.6%, 11.9%, and 7.5% of cases, respectively. Regarding antimicrobial susceptibility 82.0% of patients were susceptible to penicillin. About 87% of IE cases occurred on the left side. Of the left-side lesions, mitral valve, aortic valve, and both represented 40.3%, 32.8%, and 11.9% of the total cases. 11.9% cases had multi-valvular involvement, and all multivalvular lesions were on the left side. Eleven (16.4%) cases had the occurrence of embolization. Among patients that received echocardiography examinations, vegetation could be detected in 77.8% of cases. 68.7% of cases received both antimicrobial therapy and surgery. The overall mortality rate of S. lugdunensis IE was 38.8%. Yet on the basis of this paper the mortality rates for native valve endocarditis were 34.6, and upon univariate analysis, variables that had a significant association with mortality included age over 50 years, medical treatment alone, negative echocardiography findings and diagnosis before 1995. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, medical treatment alone was an independent risk factor for mortality (odds ratio = 4.79; 95% confidence interval = 1.16–19.78).\nOur case is an example of infective endocarditis by Staphylococcus lugdunensis on native mitral valve in a young woman of 18 with anamnesis valve prolapse. In the reported case the most likely hypothesis is that the infection was contracted during dental procedures [], dating back to about fifteen days after onset of fever and skin lesion of the gluteal region.\nConsistent with the latest guidelines of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, in this case targeted antimicrobial therapy [] was used, but there was clinical and echocardiograph evidence already present which indicated surgery (anamnesis recurrent episodes of right eye amaurosis fugax and vegetation size).\nOur clinical case presented a number of points of interest:young age in the absence of comorbidity, originated on native valve with prolapse of the same uncertain origin (dental care? skin lesions?) possible retinal or brain embolization (explaining recurrent quadrantanopia) which would indicate urgent surgery in the beginning [], systemic embolization (common iliac artery), delay in echocardiograph diagnosis, the need for surgical treatment despite the broad spectrum of microorganism antibiotic susceptibility (aggressive clinical course despite a non-MDR organism).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chest x-ray and microscopic examination of the sputum enabled a diagnosis of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis. A four-drug regimen (INH, 300 mg/day; RIF, 450 mg/day; ethambutol [EMB], 1,250 mg/day; and pyrazinamide [PZA], 1,500 mg/day) was started according to her weight of 50 kg. While normal at the start of therapy (300,000/mm3), her thrombocyte count began to decrease during the second day of treatment (18,000/mm3). The therapy was stopped, and after transfusions of fresh frozen plasma and a thrombocyte suspension, her thrombocyte count became normal. Rifampicin was assumed to be the causative factor of thrombocytopenia, and therapy was restarted with INH, PZA, and EMB. However, thrombocytopenia relapsed during this regimen. The treatment was stopped and the patient was referred to our hospital.\nWhen the patient was admitted to our hospital, her main complaint was coughing. No important previous history was present. Physical examination findings were normal with the exception of bilateral ecchymoses on her lower extremities. Chest X-ray showed a cavity with peripheral infiltration in the left upper zone. Laboratory findings revealed; sedimentation rate: 46 mm/hr, CRP: 24 mg/lt, WBC: 9,910/mm3, hemoglobin: 10 gr/dl, hematocrit: 31%, and thrombocytes: 135,000/mm3. Other parameters were noncontributory.\nBecause of the recurrent thrombocytopenia, we planned to start a treatment with a single agent and add the others one by one. The treatment was initiated in our hospital with INH at 300 mg/day, but this resulted in thrombocytopenia (30,000/mm3) on the third day, and the therapy was stopped. As soon as the thrombocyte count became normal, we began a three-drug regimen according to the patient’s weight: PZA, 1,500 mg/day; streptomycin (SM), 750 mg/day; and EMB, 1,250 mg/day. Because the thrombocyte count was normal (225,000/mm3), INH was again added to the regimen, but on the second day of INH initiation, the thrombocyte count decreased to 10,000/mm3. The INH was stopped and the patient underwent a consultation in the Hematology Department. Then a thrombocyte suspension and methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) were given. During the follow up, the thrombocyte count became normal and the methylprednisolone therapy was stopped. After re-initiation of the three-drug regimen (EMB, PZA, and SM), RIF at 450 mg/day was added to the therapy as the fourth drug. On the third day of RIF therapy, the thrombocyte count decreased to 34,000/mm3 and RIF was ceased.\nBecause of thrombocytopenia caused by both INH and RIF, moxifloxacin at 400 mg/day was added to the treatment regimen.

Growth was insidious, slowly progressing, and no history of associated pain. On intraoral examination, a huge exophytic growth measuring roughly 3 × 4 cms was noticed posterior to the mandibular left second molar. It extended anteroposteriorly from 37 to retromolar pad, buccally in the vestibule and inferiorly till the floor of the mouth. On radiographic examination, a well-defined radiolucency was found around impacted 38 (). Surgical excision of the entire intraosseous and extraosseous mass along with the removal of the impacted 38 was performed. A histopathologic diagnosis of ameloblastic fibroma was made. The patient was kept on followup.\nThe patient reported again in August 2012 with a recurrent swelling in the same area. It was associated with difficulty in mastication. There was no history of pain, paresthesia, or discharge. Intraoral examination revealed a proliferative growth measuring 5 × 4 × 3 cms and extending from 35 to retromolar area (). Submandibular lymph nodes on the ipsilateral side were enlarged. Orthopantomograph showed multilocular radiolucency involving the left side of the mandible and discontinuity of the lower border (). Hemimandibulectomy was performed with primary reconstruction using titanium plate.\nThe excised specimen consisted of left half of the body and ramus of the mandible with the tumor mass measuring 7.5 × 6.5 × 6.5 cms (). Histopathologic examination of hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections showed cords, interconnecting strands, and islands of odontogenic epithelium laid in a myxoid cell-rich stroma. The cords and strands consisted of a double layer of cuboidal cells (). The islands showed the peripheral tall columnar cells having polarized nucleus, clear vacuolated cytoplasm, and central stellate reticulum-like cells (). Juxtaepithelial hyalinization was noted around few islands. There was no hard tissue formation. The degree of cellularity varied in different areas of the lesion. Some areas were hypercellular (), whereas others were sparsely cellular and myxoid. Atypia and mitotic activities were not evident. The lesion was partly covered by fibrous capsule (). Sections were taken from different areas to look for any malignant changes. However, it was not appreciated.

Her medical history included partial symptomatic epilepsy and she was medicated with 500 mg per day VPA since two years.\nOn ED arrival, the patient was confused and somnolent. Her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 8. Vital signs included a temperature of 98.7°F, pulse of 129 beats/minute, respiration of 32 breaths/minute, blood pressure of 80/57 mmHg, and puls oximetry (SpO2) of %80 on room air. Pupils were equal at 2 mm and reactive to light. The cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rhythm with notable tachycardia without murmurs. The lungs were clear. The abdomen had positive bowel sounds and was soft, nontender, and with no hepatosplenomegaly. The extremities revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.\nIn the ED, she was treated with gastrointestinal decontamination with a single dose of activated charcoal and intravenous fluids resuscitation. Her blood VPA level at admission was 844 μg/mL (therapeutic serum concentrations range from 50 to 125 μg/mL) and ammonia level 325 μg/dL. Other laboratory values upon admission were within normal limits. Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with no ischemic changes. Her initial chest X-ray and head CT were unremarkable. During hospitalization she was still confused and lethargic but required neither airway protection nor respiratory support.\nShe was taken to the intensive care unit for continuous monitoring and due to elevated VPA level (928 μg/mL). Her level of glucose was 64 mg/dL, so 25% dextrose 100 mL was administered. Levocarnitine treatment was started (50 mg/kg per day). Nephrology was consulted for evaluation for hemodialysis. Nephrology's opinion was that she could benefit from dialysis. Urgent high-flux hemodialysis (HD) with FX80 dialyzer (helixone, 1.8 m2, Fresenius Medical Care), blood flow rate 350 mL/min, and ultrafiltration rate 450 mL/hr for duration of 4 hours was performed, using right femoral venous access.

The pain was described as continuous but with exacerbations. Previously the patient had been asymptomatic, with normal bowel habits, though upon questioning she explained that in the last two days the stools had been somewhat looser and scarcer than usual.\nBefore this episode the patient had been healthy, with normal menstruation and no medical or surgical antecedents of interest. Pregnancy up until that point had been normal. Upon admission, she weighed 52 kg, measured 155 cm in height, and had gained 10 kg in the course of pregnancy.\nThe vital functions were normal, with a temperature of 36°C and blood pressure 125/51 mmHg. Physical examination revealed a soft abdomen with pain in response to palpation in the epigastric and left hypochondriac zone but no signs of peritonism. The gynecological examination was normal, and the uterine cervix showed no modifications. The obstetric ultrasound findings were also normal, showing a fetus with longitudinal, cephalic presentation. The ultrasound measurements were consistent with dates, with normal placental insertion and amniotic fluid in normal quantities. The cardiotocographic recordings showed a reactive pattern with no contractions.\nA peripheral venous catheter was inserted to administer analgesics, obtaining a very limited response. After the first hours of observation the pain proved more intense, irradiating to the subcostal region and left side of the chest. The blood tests showed a leukocyte count of 15,480 cells/mm3 (82.3% neutrophils), 10.9 g/dL hemoglobin and 269,000 platelets/mm3. The biochemical study was normal, with Na 143 mEq/L, K 4.2 mEq/L, and Cl 107 mEq/L. The transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and amylase levels were within normal limits. Urine testing likewise showed no alterations.\nAbdominal ultrasound initially revealed no renal or liver alterations. The chest X-ray study showed left hemi-diaphragmatic elevation secondary to abundant abdominal gas in the splenic angle of the colon, with normal lung parenchyma and no alterations of the cardiomediastinal silhouette ().\nA rectal tube accompanied by postural changes and spasmolytic agents did not facilitate evacuation of the gas. Given the gradual worsening of the pain, a plain X-ray study of the abdomen was carried out, revealing notorious displacement of the gravid uterus to the right, important dilatation of the jejunal loops, and a redundant descending colon containing abundant gas. Colon obstruction was noted at pelvic level, consistent with obstructive ileus secondary to impaction of the fetal head in the dextroflexed uterus ().\nNasogastric intubation likewise failed to lessen the pain or facilitate intestinal evacuation. The general condition of the patient deteriorated as a result of intense pain. Accordingly, after 5 hours without improvement, and in view of the risk of bowel perforation as a result of the intense intestinal dilatation, we decided to perform an exploratory laparotomy, with possible fetal extraction. Betamethasone (one 12 mg dose) was administered to favor fetal pulmonary maturation. Surgery confirmed the presence of a dextroflexed uterus rotated about 90 degrees to the right, causing impaction of the head of the fetus over the sigmoid portion of the colon, compressing the lumen and producing the obstruction. There were no adherences or ischemic areas in the bowel loops suggesting other possible causes of obstruction. Cesarean section was performed, delivering a male weighing 1940 grams and with an Apgar score of 8/9.\nThe puerperal course was favorable, and 72 hours after cesarean section the patient presented complete intestinal transit, allowing us to remove the nasogastric tube and resume oral feeding (). The subsequent digestive study after puerperium did not reveal any intestinal pathology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She had a normal childbirth, no medical illness, and a normal sexual, social, and physiological development during her infancy and childhood. At age eight, she began to notice progressive hirsutism. However, she never asked for medical advice. Six years later, she was diagnosed with hypertension that was uncontrolled with full-dose telmisartan, metoprolol, prazosin, and nifedipine. She never had menarche. Two months before our evaluation, she presented a hypertensive crisis with right-sided hemiplegia and severe chest pain that relapsed after blood pressure was controlled. MRI was negative for stroke and electrocardiogram, and heart enzymes were normal. During the evaluation, a chest-abdomen CT scan was performed and a left adrenal mass of 10 × 9 cm was found (). At physical examination, heart rate was 82 per minute, blood pressure 150/90 with respiratory rate of 16 per minute, and temperature of 36.3°C. Hirutisim was evaluated based on Ferriman-Gallwey modified score (result = 24). Clitorimegaly, nondeveloped mammary glands, voice deepening and primary amenorrhea were also present (Figures , , and ). She had gone through puberty mentally and socially as a male. FSH, LH, prolactin, estradiol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and progesterone were normal. Total testosterone was 4.33 ng/mL (0.06–0.82), androstenedione 10 ng/mL (0.4–2.7), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) > 1000 μg/dL (35–430 μg/dL).

She had recurrent urticarial rashes on her eye lids and dorsum of the hands two months ago. She also had arthralgia of the arms and legs with increasing fatigue since then. Her past medical history was unremarkable. On examination, she was found to have erythematous papules over the metacarpal and interphalangeal joints. Lower extremity muscle strength was reduced (grade 3 out of 5). She had difficulties in standing up from a squatting position. Ophthalmic examination revealed violaceous eruption on eyelids with swelling. Her best corrected visual acuity was 20/600 in both eyes. Slit-lamp examination of both eyes revealed no inflammation in anterior chamber and vitreous body. No RAPD was found. Intraocular pressure was within normal limits. Bilateral fundus examination showed bilateral multiple cotton wool spots and Purtscher flecken surround the optic disc, and a few intra-retinal haemorrhages with macular pseudo-cherry red spot (Figure ). Intravenous fluorescein angiography revealed bilateral retinal arteriole and capillary occlusion around the optic disc and macular nonperfusion (Figure A, B), optic disc leakage,vessel wall staining of veins, venules and some arterioles in the late phase (Figure C, D). Bilateral Purtscher-like retinopathy was diagnosed. With the advice of a consultant dermatologist, laboratory examination was done and showed elevated levels of leucocytes and muscle enzymes, which included white blood cell count 13.8×109/L, neutrophils 96.7%, platelet count 82×109/L, mean platelet volume 8.7fl, hemoglobin level 88 g/L, creatinine kinase 341 U/L, lactate dehydrogenase 575 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 354 U/L and aspartate aminotransferase 77 U/L. The bone marrow examination and peripheral blood smear were normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 45 mm/hr. C-reactive protein was 36.2 mg/L. The rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, anti-antibodies to extractable nuclear antigen, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody and anti-Jo1 antibody were all negative. Serum viral antibody tests and anti-toxoplasmosis antibody were negative and tumour markers were not raised. Thyroid function tests were normal. The chest X-ray was normal. The electromyography study revealed myopathic features. A diagnosis of bilateral Purtscher-like retinopathy associated with dermatomyositis was made. Subsequently she was referred to the dermatological department and began treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone. Vision loss progressed to 20/400 in both eyes over the next 3 months in spite of treatment with corticosteroids. Ocular examination revealed bilateral optic disc pallor, attenuated retinal arteries and mottled RPE.\nPurtscher's retinopathy was first described in 1910 by Otmar Purtscher, in a patient with severe head trauma []. Since then, a similar retinal appearance has also been described in a variety of conditions including acute pancreatitis, crush injury, long bone fracture, orthopaedic surgery, childbirth, and connective tissue disorders []. This case was characterized by the occurrence of Purtscher-like retinopathy as an early complication of dermatomyositis. The diagnosis of dermatomyositis was according to the criteria of Bohan and Peter [].\nThe pathognomonic Purtscher flecken occur in only 50% of cases [], and they were poorly recognized and documented in many patients []. These polygonal areas of retinal whitening occur in the inner retina, between the affected retinal arterioles and venules and have a characteristic clear zone, which described as an average of 50 μm unaffected zone on either side of the retinal arteries and precapillary arterioles []. Large emboli produce the confluent retinal whitening, which can be seen in branch retinal arterial obstruction, whereas distal retinal capillaries occlusion by small emboli forms the cotton-wool spots. Purtscher flecken results from occlusion of precapillary arterioles by intermediate-sized emboli.\nSeveral kinds of emboli have been reported to participate in the pathogenesis of Purtscher’s retinopathy and Purtscher-like retinopathy, such as air, fat, leukocyte aggregates, fibrin, platelets and complement activation []. Brigitte et al. have described Purtscher-like retinopathy in a 7-year-old boy with severe juvenile dermatomyositis, suggesting that retinal vascular involvement might result from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) rather than as a complication of juvenile dermatomyositis []. However, dermatomyositis seems to have been the cause of our patient’s retinopathy because she didn’t meet the criteria for TTP. Dermatomyositis is characterized pathologically by varying degrees of perifascicular atrophy, vasculopathy, and perivascular inflammation []. Obviously some factors such as leukocytes and inflammation may play an important role in our patient. Leukocyte aggregates induced by complement activation, which occur in connective tissue disorders, are usually up to 50 μm in diameter and may occlude the 45 μm diameter precapillary arterioles in the human retina []. Vasculitis due to the capillary endothelial damage by inflammatory factors may also contribute to the pathogenesis.\nAt present no treatment has been proven to be definitely effective []. Isolated case reports suggest that treatment of Purtscher's retinopathy with high dose intravenous steroids may be beneficial []. While in a prospective observational study, spontaneous visual recovery of at least 2 Snellen lines is seen in half of the cases []. The poor outcome of visual acuity may be associated with the optic disc or macular involvement and the extent of retinal vascular occlusion [].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On expanding the history, the patient elicited trauma due to road traffic accident two days back. Clinical extraoral examination revealed lacerations on the lower lip. Intraoral examination revealed grade II mobility i.r.t 11 and complicated crown fracture i.r.t 12 ().\nOn investigating the intraoral periapical radiograph (), a horizontal fracture line was seen i.r.t 11 at the junction of coronal and middle third with minimal displacement of fracture fragments. So the final diagnosis was established as Ellis Class VI fracture i.r.t 11, Ellis Class III fracture i.r.t 12, Ellis Class I fracture i.r.t 21, with moderate dental fluorosis.\nTaking into consideration the prognostic factors regarding root fracture i.r.t 11, patient was clearly informed about the various treatment options available either to save the tooth or to send it for extraction. On obtaining the informed consent, a comprehensive treatment plan was devised for the patient which consisted of managing the root fracture i.r.t 11 with MTA as a splint material, post and core rehabilitation for tooth number 12, along with direct and indirect composite restorations.\nInitial treatment began with splinting the teeth using orthodontic braided wire and flowable composite as a rigid splint for a period of 6 weeks according to Andreason's protocol ().\nEndodontic treatment was initiated i.r.t 11 and 12; after access opening of 12, cleaning and shaping were carried out with hand K-files using step back technique, followed by obturation by using resin sealer (AH Plus; Dentsply; lot number 1209000390, Germany) and lateral condensation method.

A repeat Pap smear was obtained at 12 weeks gestation which again showed atypical endocervical cells favoring neoplastic changes, which were concerning for adenocarcinoma. Screening for high risk HPV was negative, and no lesion was visible on colposcopy. Despite the usual recommendation against endocervical curettage (ECC) during pregnancy, this procedure was cautiously done at 15 weeks gestation, finding only mucous and inflammatory cells, but no identifiable epithelium.\nCervical conization was recommended, but was declined by the patient. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed, with no signs of cervical mass, parametrial disease, or lymphadenopathy. The patient declined further evaluation until 31 weeks gestation, when she had a directed biopsy of a clinically suspicious lesion. Pathology showed adenocarcinoma in situ, but was again concerning for invasive adenocarcinoma. An ECC also showed atypical glandular material.

She had a history of swelling since 8 months which was slowly increasing in size. She had no prior medical or family history of treatment for any chronic infective disease. Patient was thin built and moderately nourished. The patient pre-sented with trismus and a moderate sized swelling present on left side of face in the preauricular region with no sinus or discharging pus. Overlying skin was normal in colour and ear lobule was not elevated. Swelling was tender and firm on palpation. A lymph node was palpable, tender and of 1.5 x 1.5 cm size in left submandibular area. Presence of trismus restricted examination of oral cavity; an ulcerative lesion over the retro molar region in relation to impacted 38 was seen. Tenderness was present over the retro molar region in relation to 38. Provisional differential diagnosis came as space infection/ pericoronitis in relation to impacted 38/ periapical abscess.\nIn radiographic findings (Fig. ) panoramic view showed diffuse radiolucency in the ramus of mandible with loss of cortication on the superior and anterior portion of condyle, the extent of destruction observed lead to the suspicion that a larger lesion may be present within the ramus (Fig - A). Cone Beam Computed Tomograph (CBCT) of the left TMJ showed pronounced rarefaction and destruction of bone in the ramus with discontinuity of the cortical boundary suggestive of perforation and erosion of the condyloid head (Fig - D). Radiographic diagnosis came as Osteomyelitic changes in relation to left condyle and ramus.\nUltrasound finding showed an approximately 4 x 1 cm. sized hypoechoic collection with internal echoes within, is seen in muscular plane with erosion of underlying mandible.\nImpression came as Left mandibular ramus osteomyelitis with collection.\nFine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) (Fig -E) of the left parotid region swelling showed purulent material aspirated and smear shows abundant caseous necrosis, occasional epithelial cell granulomas, aggregated poly-morphs and few lymphocytes. Histological findings came as cold abscess, suggestive of tuberculosis. Final diagnosis came as extra pulmonary tuberculosis with osteomyelitis. Patient was referred to medical department where after confirming diagnosis she was started with Directly Observed Therapy, Short Course (DOTs) and was kept on periodic follow up.

No other complaints were reported. She was, however, admitted to hospital 18 months previously for the same complaint, and treated conservatively as a case of sub-acute intestinal obstruction. She lived with her parents, had no evident psychiatric illness, drug history or known allergy, and had no prior surgical history.\nA clinical examination revealed that our patient was fully conscious, mildly dehydrated and neither pale nor jaundiced. Her body weight, heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate were all within normal ranges. She had an obvious asymmetrical abdominal distension with a centrally inverted umbilicus, and no scar was observed. Her abdomen was soft on palpation, with a left hypochondrial intra-abdominal immobile mass, extending to her epigastric region, measuring about 16cm × 10cm. Another mobile oval mass was also seen in her left iliac fossa, measuring about 8cm × 5cm. Both masses had well-defined round edges and smooth surfaces, and were not tender, compressible or pulsatile. Her bowel sounds were exaggerated and high pitched, and both her rectum (by digital examination) and hernia orifices were empty. Laboratory results showed the following: packed cell volume, 36%; white blood cells, 8×109 cells/L; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 16mm/hour; blood urea, 6.2mmol/L; serum creatinine, 110μmol/L; serum potassium, 4.2mmol/L; serum sodium, 138mmol/L.\nAn abdominal X-ray showed a well-defined, rounded soft tissue density mass in her central abdominal region, with calcification (Figures and ). An abdominal ultrasound showed a central abdominal oval lesion, with peripheral calcification and gaseous bowel distension; the lesion was not related to her liver or spleen. A computed tomography scan was not performed as it was not available in our emergency department.\nConservative treatment was initiated by stopping oral feeding, placing a nasogastric tube, and starting intravenous fluids. Our patient received antibiotic treatment (cefotaxime 1g and metronidazole 500mg) and was put under observation. Her condition deteriorated, with her temperature reaching 37.8°C 12 hours after admission, and her pulse rate increasing to 120 beats/minute, although her blood pressure remained within normal range (110/70mmHg). A physical examination of her abdomen showed mild tenderness in her lower abdomen, and ‘tinkling’ bowel sounds. The nasogastric tube collected 300cm3 of watery fluid over 12 hours. Explorative laparotomy identified two masses, one in her stomach and another in her ileum. We used a combination of gastrotomy and enterotomy to remove the trichobezoars from both her stomach and the ileum (Figures and ).

All laboratory tests including complete blood count, renal, bone, hepatic, and coagulation profiles, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alfa-feto protein (AFP), and CA (cancer antigen) 12-5 were normal.\nContrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed a 4.2 × 3.2 cm, heterogeneous noncalcified mass involving most probably the right adrenal gland region (Figures and ). The right renal vein and inferior vena cava were intact. There was no pleural effusion, ascites, or lymphadenopathy. No pelvic masses were identified. Patient was scheduled for surgical resection.\nOn laparotomy, the mass was not found in its radiologically expected location, and the right kidney and right adrenal gland were intact. The right-sided lower part of diaphragm was opened, and the mass was interestingly found inside the thorax attached to the pleura. The mass was resected successfully and sent for histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis.\nMicroscopically, pathological sections from the mass showed a well-encapsulated mass with predominant myxoid areas in plexiform configuration. Alternating Antoni A cellular areas with Verocay bodies and Antoni B hypocellular areas with myxoid changes and thick-walled blood vessels with perivascular hyalinization were noted. No mitosis or necrosis was noted (Figures –). Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells stained positive for S100 protein () and negative for cytokeratin, CD117, CD34, and ALK. A final histopathological diagnosis of primary pleural benign myxoid peripheral nerve sheath tumor (consistent with schwannoma) was established.\nPatient had an uneventful postoperative course following surgery.

Her exam was notable for right optic nerve pallor and atrophy. A brain MRI without contrast due to her pregnancy showed a right supraclinoid mass measuring 2.5 × 2.2 × 2.5 cm, for which she was referred for neurosurgical evaluation. No other neurological deficits were present on examination. Considering the stability of the visual deficit and the late gestational age, a contrast study was postponed until after her delivery. The subsequent MRI confirmed an extra-axial mass in the right clinoid region with homogenous enhancement and interval growth of the lesion to 2.9 × 3.0 × 2.0 cm (). There were mild mass effect upon the right aspect of the optic chiasm, evidence of a dural tail, encasement of the right internal carotid artery, and possible extension into the right cavernous sinus. Collectively, these findings radiologically suggested a diagnosis of a right clinoidal meningioma.\nThe patient subsequently underwent surgical resection via a right frontotemporal craniotomy. Intraoperatively, the frontal excursion of the tumor had a well-defined arachnoid plane, but further opening of the dura revealed tumor infiltration of the optic nerve, which was unexpected for a meningioma. A biopsy was taken from the superior truncal aspect of the tumor and sent to pathology for intraoperative diagnosis, which returned a diagnosis of pilocytic astrocytoma. The final pathology report described a proliferation of piloid glial cells of low to moderate cellularity associated with abundant Rosenthal fibers, rare eosinophilic granular bodies, and microvascular proliferation mostly located at the periphery of the tumor (). A few pilomyxoid features were noted, including abundant extracellular mucin, some perivascular pseudorosetting, and paucity of eosinophilic granular bodies. Collectively, the histologic findings confirmed a diagnosis of pilocytic astrocytoma, WHO grade I.\nPostoperatively, the patient recovered without significant complications and reported improved overall vision at her one-month follow-up visit.

She developed symptoms of decreased tearing in the right eye 1 week after surgery and reported that only the left side of her nose became congested when she developed a cold.\nAt the time of her visit, the patient’s corrected vision was 20/20 for both eyes. No relative afferent pupillary defect was observed. Upon slit-lamp examination, punctuated epithelial erosion was observed on the cornea of the right eye. Hypoesthesia to light touch in the right malar area, which is the domain of the zygomaticofacial nerve, was also confirmed. The patient’s tear film breakup time was 5 s in the right eye and 7 s in the left eye. The findings of Schirmer I test were 5 mm for the right eye and 10 mm for the left eye. The results of the Schirmer II test, which measures the degree of reflex tearing by irritating the nasal cavities, were 4 mm for the right eye and 12 mm for the left.

She started the symptoms spontaneously 3 years ago, which attacked several times a month and lasted from 2 to more than 10 hours, even days occasionally. She noticed that the episodes always started on the cheeks and then radiated rapidly over the adjacent areas including ears and forehead without any other associations including scales, sweating and headache. The most painful areas were the cheeks. The symptoms disappeared completely without any other facial lesions between episodes. She was diagnosed as seborrheic dermatitis and was treated with oral antihistamines, topical steroids and tacrolimus, and cool facial masque. The therapeutics seemed to be moderately beneficial, whereas cooling the lesion during the attack usually led to rapid pain relief. During the course, she found that the frequency and severity of the flares progressed gradually. She also noticed that warmth and movement could trigger the attacks or worsen the symptoms while cleaning her teeth, eating, drinking, brushing her hair, touching or rubbing the ears or neck movements had little influence on the attacks; and she preferred to stay in cold environment during the flares since the onset. For the past weeks, she was having constant attacking with nocturnal progress when lying down, which seriously disturbed her quality of life including sleep. The symptoms had poor response to the previously mentioned therapeutics except the cooling face masque. Because of intolerable pain, she had to spray cold water or use cold masque on the lesion all day long. The lesions had never involved the extremities. She had no prior history of migraine, episodic headaches or neck injury. Her family history was also unremarkable.\nOn physical examination, she was healthily appearing. During the flare, both ears including the entire helix and antihelix, the forehead and the face were evidently red and tender associated with warmth (Figure a-c). The most painful areas were the cheeks. The temperature on the cheek, forehead and axilla was 36.8 degrees centigrade, 36.7 degrees centigrade and 36.8 degrees centigrade, respectively during the attack. She had no swollen plaque over the involved areas and had no lesions on other parts including feet, hands, neck. Dermatoscope showed evidently dilated vessels inside the erythema during the episodes, which decreased markedly after application of ice over the erythema for about 5 minutes. The lesional redness and pain could be alleviated markedly and rapidly by topical application of ice, but resumed rapidly after the removal of ice. Her heart rate and blood pressure were normal during the attacking. Laboratory test for complete blood cell count, chemistry profiles, liver function tests, auto-immune antibodies, antistreptolysin O serology, HIV antibody and TPPA were either within normal limits or negative. The patient refused to take biopsy.\nThe lesions improved markedly after having been treated with oral gabapentin and indomethacin, and topical lidocaine compounds and cold masque for 3 days; but recurrence occurred 2 weeks after the quit of the treatment. She was then treated with aspirin 0.1, twice a day; paroxetine 10 mg daily, which resulted in complete disappearance of the symptoms after having been treated for 2 weeks.

During the examination, a tumor of the cervix was found. Immediate biopsy was performed, and the patient was referred to the onco-gynaecological centre. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis revealed a tumor measuring 80 × 90 × 80 mm, growing from the cervical region, de facto resembling the uterus (), filling the vagina, pressing on the bladder and rectum, without clear invasion into adjacent organs. At the same time, presacral lymphadenopathy (30 × 15 × 15 mm) was present, as well as bilateral iliac lymphadenopathy (28 × 21 × 40 mm). A very rare, small cell carcinoma, hypercalcemic type (large cell subtype) was confirmed by biopsy. The baseline level of serum calcium was normal.\nDuring explorative laparotomy, the removal of lymphadenopathy with histologically confirmed metastases of hypercalcemic small cell carcinoma was successful. However, radical hysterectomy without residual disease was impossible, unless the patient underwent anterior pelvic exenteration. The patient was immediately indicated for chemotherapy via our multidisciplinary team. In the absence of any treatment recommendations, first-line cisplatin plus etoposide combined chemotherapy was selected, with regular pelvic MRI before each subsequent cycle to monitor the treatment response. After 2 cycles of chemotherapy, progression of the disease in the uterus was found, with infiltration of bilateral parametria, the bladder wall and anterior rectal wall infiltration. Distant dissemination on whole-body CT was not clearly demonstrated, except for non-specific small lesions of both lungs up to 5 mm.\nDue to gynaecological bleeding and micturition problems, the patient underwent extended-field pelvic radiotherapy with retroperitoneal lymph-nodes up to 45 Gy in 25 fractions, with a subsequent boost to the tumor, uterus and vagina up to a total dose of 59.4 Gy in 33 fractions. The pattern of tumor growth outside the uterus was not suitable for intracavitary brachytherapy. The patient managed radiotherapy without complications with clinical relief from both bleeding and urinary symptoms. The partial regression of both the tumor and lymphadenopathy was confirmed by MRI ().\nThree months after radiotherapy, 7 months from the initial diagnosis, the patient was admitted to the hospital for general deterioration, breathlessness, fever, loss of appetite, and pain. Immediate CT of the head ruled out brain metastases. Although partial regression of the pelvic tumor was confirmed on the whole-body CT scan, there was massive systemic progression of the disease with mediastinal and neck lymphadenopathy, multiple metastatic lesions of the lungs and pleura with bilateral pleural effusions, multiple liver metastases (largest 52 × 36 mm), omental involvement with soft tissue masses (largest 72 × 56 mm), and ascites (). The patient died due to an extremely rapid disease progression before 2nd line palliative chemotherapy could start.\nIn the present case, the diagnosis of hypercalcemic small cell carcinoma (large cell subtype was based on the microscopic appearance of the tumor in hematoxylin and eosin staining and the result of immunohistochemical examination).\nMicroscopically, the tumor was composed entirely of large cells with vesicular, less commonly hyperchromatic nuclei, frequently with prominent nucleoli, and with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, sometimes imparting a rhabdoid appearance (). Small cell component, characteristic for “classic” variant of SCCOHT, was absent. Follicle-like spaces or mucinous components were not observed. Microscopic appearance of lymph node metastases was identical to the tumor seen in the cervical biopsy.\nImmunohistochemically, the tumor cells showed diffuse or nearly diffuse expression of broad-spectrum cytokeratins (CK), CK18, PTEN, β-catenin (membranous), vimentin, and GATA3. Expression of MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6 was retained in tumor cell nuclei, indicating the absence of microsatellite instability (MSI). There was focal expression of p16. Isolated tumor cells showed expression of PAX8, CD10, calretinin, and synaptophysin. Detection of CK5/6, CK7, CK19, CK20, EMA, p63, p40, ER, PR, CEA, chromogranin, CD56, WT1, SALL4, Oct3/4, CD30, glypican-3, inhibin, SOX10, melan A, HMB-45, and LCA gave negative results. The expression of PD-L1 was negative in the tumor. The most diagnostically beneficial finding was the complete loss of SMARCA4 (a.k.a. BRG-1) expression (). Expression of both ARID1A and SMARCB1 (a.k.a. INI-1) was maintained.\nHPV DNA detection and genotypization was performed by qualitative real-time PCR with the AmoyDx Human Papillomavirus Genotyping Detection Kit (Amoy Diagnostics, China). In a DNA extract of the tumor tissue, no HPV DNA was detected.\nBoth germline and somatic WES of the patient and the tumor was performed. Library for whole exome capture and sequencing was prepared from DNA extracted from patient´s blood and tumor using TruSeq Exome Kit according to the manufacturer´s instructions. Prepared library was loaded onto NextSeq 500/550 Mid Output Kit v2.5 (150 cycles) and sequenced on the NextSeq 500 instrument (all Illumina, CA, United States). Sequencing coverage for exomes was >20× at > 90% of captured regions.\nThe mutation burden of the tumor was low (4 mutations/Mb). Examination of both the germline and somatic exome revealed the following selected variants ():\nThere were no other variants of the genes encoding SWI/SNF complex found, including ARID1A (wild-type), SMARCA2 (wild-type), SMARCB1 (common variables in non-coding sequencies), and others.\nAs several germline likely pathogenic or pathogenic gene variants were detected by WES (PALB2, BRCA2, SMARCA4), genetic testing was recommended also to the patient’s family.\nA heterozygous c.3976G>T/p.E1326* variant in the SMARCA4 gene and c.8350C>T/p.R2784W variant in the BRCA2 gene was detected in the mother of a patient (39 years old, no malignancy). Mother’s familial history was also negative for malignancy.\nThe patient’s father (42 years, no malignancy) showed a heterozygous c.509_510delGA/p.R170fs variant in the PALB2 gene. Father’s father (a heavy smoker) died of lung cancer at the age of 51; the father’s mother died of an unknown malignancy at the age of 64 years; and the father’s brother died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 38 years.\nThe patient’s brother (23 years old, no malignancy) showed a familial heterozygous PALB2 variant inherited from the father.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DonALd mAxweLl,18,F,AB+,Obesity,07-08-2019,Paul Daugherty,Maxwell-Edwards,UnitedHealthcare,24101.24472,497,Elective,28-08-2019,Penicillin,Normal,"Ms. M. is an 18-year-old white biological female, a high school senior with no prior history of psychiatric care, who sought an evaluation in our clinic partially at the urging of her father. She requested that we use female pronouns to address her. We met with Ms. M in person, and, with her consent, we spoke with her father over the phone.\nAccording to Ms. M's father, Ms. M. would “obsess” about particular themes starting in infancy. Between ages 1 and 3, she fixated on red objects; she would cry for hours until she was handed one. Ms. M's father stated that in kindergarten, Ms. M became “obsessed” with Pixar's Ratatouille movie, which featured a rat that dreamt of becoming a chef; she would watch it daily and “constantly” talked about it. Eventually, Ms. M's interest shifted to Super Mario 3D World, a video game she would play “incessantly.” The highly engaging, narrow interest would change every 1–2 years into adolescence, and, when at age 16, Ms. M first mentioned to her family that she had been preoccupied with gender identity-related doubt, her father assumed it was “another obsession.”\nMs. M. reported first crossing traditional gender roles at age 8. She would steal her father's razor and shaving supplies and engage in enjoyable solitary play in the bathroom, trying to shave her non-existent facial hair in front of the mirror. The behavior continued for ~3 years until she got caught after accidentally cutting herself. In high school, Ms. M. started questioning her assigned gender more explicitly, wondering whether she might feel more fulfilled as a male. Her doubts grew to daily preoccupations as the disconnect she felt between her assigned gender and the one she identified with became increasingly distressing. Imagining herself adopting typically male social roles and physical traits was comforting and made her feel “at peace.” She did not feel compelled to do anything to alleviate the gender identity doubts, such as checking to make sure she is female or seeking reassurance about it. Her menstrual cycle and secondary female sexual characteristics like breast tissue and rounded hips became sources of discomfort for her. She described going from doubting whether she might identify more with being male to believing she was male but doubting whether society would accept her as such. As she increasingly researched gender issues online, she found support in transgender community forums and developed the courage to share her struggle with her parents.\nMs. M. completed the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) checklist () in clinic, which revealed that Ms. M was at times bothered by asymmetrical arrangements but was not driven to rearrange her environment. She also experienced rare intrusive, bothersome thoughts about inadvertently harming her siblings, without any history of aggression and associated neutralizing ritual or avoidance. She expressed some superstitions around the number 13, without associated compulsions or avoidance. Together, the symmetry, harm and superstition concerns occupied <30 min daily and did not cause significant distress or functional impairment, thereby failing to support the diagnosis of OCD. Her Y-BOCS score was 7.\nMs. M. described close relationships, including with her parents, two brothers, and three lifelong friends. She has enjoyed superior grades in high school and has just been accepted to college, where she intends to major in psychology. She has never been sexually active and describes being physically attracted to females.\nMs. M. seemed relieved to hear that her gender identity-based doubts were not consistent with OCD, despite the existence of subclinical OCD symptoms unrelated to gender. She declined a referral to a clinic that specializes in providing support around gender identity issues, fearing that its providers might “push” her toward coming out as transgender before she was ready to do so. Ms. M. did, however, agree to seek out a general therapist for supportive counseling. As no clinical diagnosis was made, Ms. M. was not scheduled for a return visit to the specialty OCD clinic where we saw her, and we have no information on whether she subsequently pursued seeing a general therapist.\nOur conceptualization of Ms. M's gender-related doubts did not entirely satisfy her father, however, who viewed Ms. M's gender identity questioning as a likely transient obsession that will subside over time. Interpreting the situation as a “treatable” OCD crisis seemed easier than the possibility of having a transgender child.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WYatt busH,18,F,A-,Arthritis,03-05-2024,Elizabeth Jones,Wilson PLC,Aetna,18172.50814,330,Urgent,31-05-2024,Ibuprofen,Normal,"An 18-year-old female patient who did not have any prior medical history presented high grade fever, systemic lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion. An inguinal lymph node biopsy showed an infiltration of CD30+ middle-sized lymphoid cells. The chromosomal analysis of the lymph node revealed t(2;5)(p23;q35) (Fig. A) that creates a fusion gene composed of nucleophosmin and ALK (NPM-ALK) and fluorescence in situ hybridization showed ALK gene translocation (Fig. B). Bone marrow examination was performed and showed an infiltration of middle to large sized atypical lymphoid cells with basophilic vacuolated cytoplasm (Fig. C). Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) showed fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in systemic lymph nodes, lungs, liver, spleen, and bones (Fig. A). She had bilateral lung infiltration and pleural effusion that caused persistent coughing. Laboratory tests revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 13.3 × 109/L and CRP 10.81 mg/dL at admission. On day 19 of admission, WBC count increased to 134.3 × 109/L with 58% of abnormal lymphocytes and CRP 18.03 mg/dL. Given these clinical findings, we diagnosed her with stage IV ALK+ ALCL with leukemic presentation and planned to start chemotherapy with ALCL-99.[ However, after the pre-phase (dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide), she still had moderate pleural effusion. Then, we switched to CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone) to avoid using methotrexate. CHOP therapy decreased the total number of circulating abnormal lymphocytes, shrunk the surficial lymph nodes, decreased pleural effusion, and ameliorated her fever. However, on day 8 after CHOP, her laboratory test still showed 5.9 × 109/L of WBCs with 97% abnormal lymphocytes. We then gave her BV, which only decreased the ratio of abnormal lymphocytes to 20–40% in WBCs. On day 17 after CHOP, she already started developing fever and we gave her ALCL-99 course A (dexamethasone, methotrexate, ifosfamide, cytarabine, and etoposide) and course B (dexamethasone, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin) sequentially. Despite these intensive therapies, her circulating lymphoma cells did not decrease and she developed high fever. We decided to initiate ALK inhibitor therapy. At this point, neither crizotinib nor alectinib were approved for use in ALK+ ALCL in Japan. We chose to move forward with crizotinib because this drug had undergone the most thorough evaluation, with demonstrated efficacy against ALK+ ALCL in multiple studies from USA and European countries[ at that time. We selected crizotinib at a dose of 165 mg/m2 twice daily for salvage therapy as off-label use in Japan. Written informed consent from the patient and parents, and approval from the institutional committee for off-label use were obtained. Two weeks after initiating crizotinib, circulating abnormal lymphocytes started decreasing and disappeared on day 40. During crizotinib therapy, BV was simultaneously used twice three weeks apart. Although she had received 1 g/m2 of methotrexate as a part of ALCL regimen twice, we did not give her any intrathecal chemotherapy (IT) while detectable lymphoma cells were in circulation. Unfortunately, she developed left-sided vision disturbance right after crizotinib therapy and her brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that the enlargement of left optic nerve (Fig. A). We confirmed that she had central nervous system (CNS) infiltration of lymphoma by detecting lymphoma cells in her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This was controlled after she received whole brain irradiation (14.4 Gray), as well as 4 doses of intra thecal (IT) chemotherapy (methotrexate, cytarabine and dexamethasone) given weekly. Since we already had the plan to perform allogeneic HSCT using 12 Gray of TBI, the dose of WBRT was reduced to 14.4 Gray. Before the 1st IT, CSF cell count was 123. After second IT, it became zero. A brain MRI after 4 doses of IT and WBRT showed an improvement of optic nerve enlargement (Fig. B). A PET/CT scan showed no abnormal FDG uptake (Fig. B) and bone marrow examination did not show any lymphoma cell infiltration (Fig. D) on day 43 and 47 after crizotinib, respectively. She received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from an HLA-matched sibling donor. She was conditioned with a myeloablative regimen consisting of 12 Gray total body irradiation, 30 mg/kg etoposide, and 120 mg/kg cyclophosphamide. Crizotinib was stopped a day before the initiation of conditioning.[ As prophylaxis for acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), administration of 3 mg/kg of cyclosporine was started on day -1, and short-term methotrexate was given on days +1, +3, and +6. She promptly achieved engraftment with complete chimerism. Acute GVHD was not observed. Her bone marrow study did not show any lymphoma cell infiltration on day 35. She was discharged on day 37 after BMT without restarting crizotinib. However, she developed high fever with axillary lymph node swelling on day 60 and was readmitted to our hospital. A biopsy of the axillary lymph node revealed ALK+ ALCL relapse. We could not detect lymphoma cells in BM, however, the polymorphism analysis showed 7.9% of recipient pattern. Since she did not develop any neurological symptoms, we did not perform lumber puncture. Immediately after the biopsy, we started giving her crizotinib at the same dose. Within 2 days, her high fever was completely resolved. However, she developed grade 3 nausea due to crizotinib, prompting us to stop crizotinib and switch to alectinib, which is reported to have higher selectivity in ALK inhibition with decreased toxicity.[ Again, written informed consent from the patient and parents was obtained to use alectinib off-label. Alectinib was given a dose of 300 mg twice daily that did not cause any adverse events. The patient achieved CR again confirmed by CT, which was durable without any further chemotherapy for 4 months up until she received an umbilical cord transplantation. Six months after her first transplantation, she received umbilical cord blood transplantation at 2nd CR using 5/8 allele-matched cord blood from a male donor. The conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine 25 mg/m2 for 6 days, busulfan 3.2 mg/kg for 4 days, and melphalan 40 mg/m2 for 2 days. For prophylaxis of GVHD, she was given 0.03 mg/kg of tacrolimus and short-term methotrexate on days +1, +3, and +6. The number of total transplanted nucleated cells and CD34+ cells were 2.3 × 107/kg and 0.8 × 105/kg, respectively. She achieved engraftment promptly without developing acute GVHD. On day 40, she restarted on alectinib as maintenance therapy. She has been in CR with limited chronic GVHD for more than 16 months under alectinib treatment. She did not develop any cognitive disorder thus far. Her clinical course is summarized in Figure .\nThe patient and parents have provided informed consent for publication of this case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first mass developed at age 12 near menarche, with several more masses developing and increasing in size over time. She was otherwise healthy, and family history was notable for nasopharyngeal cancer in her paternal grandfather and brain cancer in a paternal cousin who died at age 6 (Fig. ).\nOn physical examination, the breast tissue was nearly replaced by multiple smooth, mobile, non-tender, well circumscribed nodules each measuring 1–2 cm in size, with a 4 cm mass in the outer right breast. She had no lymphadenopathy, trichilemmomas, oral papillomatosis, or acral keratosis. There was keratosis pilaris of the upper arms.\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the breasts (Fig. ) showed innumerable, bilateral breast masses ranging in size from 0.5 to 4 cm, and two fine needle biopsies cytomorphology supported a diagnosis of fibroadenoma (Fig. ). Alternative diagnoses including phyllodes tumor were considered but not seen on biopsy. This patient did not meet criteria for testing under NCCN guidelines and suspicion for underlying hereditary cancer risk was low. However, a custom 100 gene hereditary cancer panel was ordered (Supplementary Material), for genes such as ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, and PTEN due to the rarity of early onset, bilateral, and multiple fibroadenomas with limited family history.\nGenetic testing identified a pathogenic mutation in the PTEN gene consistent with PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome. Subsequent genetic testing of both parents was negative, consistent with a de novo mutation in this patient, which occurs in 11–48% of PTEN mutation carriers [].\nAfter discussion of management options, including excisional biopsy of the largest mass, observation, high risk screening with breast MRI, or risk reducing bilateral mastectomies, this patient opted for surgical risk reduction with bilateral mastectomies and reconstruction in the near future. This decision was based on the high lifetime risk of breast cancer, difficulty with surveillance due to the presence of innumerable masses, and patient’s symptoms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The masses were painless for the first eight months but became so painful in the last 6 months prior to her presentation. She had been treated as a case of a possible bacterial mastitis with topical and oral antibiotics for two months without any significant improvement and was referred to UCI with a clinical suspect for bilateral inflammatory breast cancer. However, due to financial challenges the patient did not reach UCI until a year later. By then, she had developed a serosanguinous nipple discharge, generalized body weakness, weight loss, and lower limb swelling extending up to the knees. She had no cough, chest pain, night sweats, or fever. She had no prior history of chronic illness or a family history of a cancer. Her menarche was at the age of 14 years.\nOn physical examination, the patient was cachectic and mildly pale with normal vital signs. She had multiple, firm matted lymph nodes in the right posterior triangle of the neck, both axillae and bilateral inguinal regions. There were no supraclavicular enlarged lymph nodes. The breasts had hypopigmentation with visible bleeding in some areas. The nipples and areolae of both breasts were coated with layers of a whitish powder (Figure ). There were multiple small masses in both breasts that were irregular, tender, and firm-to-hard in consistency. Chest examinations were essentially normal except for a right basal crepitation. Both lower extremities demonstrated pitting edema up to the knee.\nComplete blood count showed hemoglobin of 10.9 g/dL, total white cell count of 13 680/dL, and platelet count of 460 000/dL. Blood chemistry showed blood urea nitrogen, 263 mg/dL; creatinine, 1 mg/dL; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 2010 U/L; and serum alkaline phosphatase, 173 U/L.\nBreast ultrasound examination demonstrated bilateral tender breasts with multiple hyperechoic and hypoechoic lesions of ill-defined margins, subcutaneous lesions, and skin thickening in both breasts. There were multiple matted enlarged hypoechoic lymph nodes with very small hilum in some of the nodes in both axillae (Figure ).\nSince inflammatory breast cancer was suspected, an ultrasound-guided Tru-cut biopsy of the lumps in both breasts was performed. Hematoxylin and eosin section (Figure ) showed effacement of the normal architecture by a diffuse infiltrate of large, pleomorphic lymphoid cells with vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli, and no Reed Sternberg cells were seen. Immunohistochemistry showed cluster of differentiation (CD)-3 positivity and CD20 negative.\nUltrasound scan of the abdomen for staging showed hepatosplenomegaly, mesenteric, para-aortic and bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy, and a well-defined, solid, hypoechoic pelvic mass originating from the fundus of the uterus with no color flow on Doppler. The left kidney was echogenic with dilated calyces but of normal size.\nChest radiographs demonstrated right middle and lower lung zone reticulo-nodular opacities with thickened horizontal fissure. The retrosternal space was filled with homogenous opacity.\nEchocardiography demonstrated normal cardiac structure and function. However, multiple matted lymph nodes in the anterior and superior mediastinum were seen during echocardiography examination.\nThe histopathologic and radiographic investigations confirmed a stage IV T-cell NHL with secondary extranodal involvement of both breasts.

As the nodule was suspected to be malignant, and the patient complained of numbness in her left upper extremity, multimodal ultrasound (US) imaging was performed using B-mode, color doppler, ultrasonic elastography (UE) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). The nodule measured 3.3 cm in diameter, and demonstrated a sharp margin, heterogeneous echogenicity, and “target sign” in B-mode US (Fig. A), and intramural blood flow on color Doppler (Fig. B). As the nodule was suspected to be malignant, further examination was performed using UE and CEUS. UE showed that the thyroid nodule was of medium hardness with a strain ratio of 1.14 (Fig. C), indicating that the lesion was benign. CEUS was performed by injecting 1 ml of the contrast agent Sonovue (Bracco, Italy). The results revealed that malignancy could not be excluded, and the lesion was classified as TI-RADS 4b (Fig. D). Fine needle aspiration (FNA) (22-G) was performed under CEUS guidance and markedly enhanced areas were targeted for biopsy. FNA cytological results revealed that the lesion was a benign schwannoma. A partial thyroidectomy was performed. Intraoperatively, the tumor was found to be an encapsulated mass over the left lobe of the thyroid gland, without involvement of the surrounding structures. Hematoxylin and eosin (H-E) stained sections revealed that the resected tissue was composed of fusiform spindle-shaped cells densely arranged in fascicules (Fig. ). The final diagnosis was a benign primary thyroid schwannoma. After thyroidectomy, the patient was followed up by US for 3 years.

The patient was admitted to the ICU of the Clinical Hospital in Lviv in November 2018 with a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, a stage of decompensation, a degree I coma, and a history of subdural hematoma, periodic episodes of diabetes decompensation due to nonadherence to diet. The patient had a central venous catheter. Additionally, lumbar puncture and tracheal intubation were performed in the patient on day two after hospitalization. The patient received an erythrocyte mass transfusion on day four and a tracheostomy on day five. Body temperature increased from 37.0-37.8°C at the time of admission to 38.5-39.0°C on day five after tracheal intubation. At that time, the patient presented with left-sided hydrothorax (according to Rtg) and pulmonary edema. Ceftriaxone and levofloxacin were administered on day one and fluconazole on day two after hospitalization.\nA tracheostomy obtained a bronchial aspirate at day five for microbiological evaluation. At the time of biopsy sampling, the patient had a leukocytosis of 16 × 109/l (N 4-9) with a left shift—myelocytes 1 (N 0), young (meta-leukocytes) 2 (N 0-1), and increased ESR (35 mm/h [N 1-15]). According to the inoculation results, the R. terrigena culture was detected in an amount of 106 CFU/mL. The results of the antibiogram for Patient 2 are shown in Table and compared with those for Patient 1. Targeted pulmonary infection elimination was not possible due to the patient's death from diabetes mellitus decompensation on the second day after receiving the inoculation results. The pathological autopsy revealed a concomitant bilateral small focal lower lobe acinar purulent bronchopneumonia in addition to the underlying disease.\nWe used PubMed and Google Scholar databases to find all possible information, using search terms “Raoultella terrigena,” “Raoultella,” and “Klebsiella terrigena,” from 1988 to 2021 years. Only papers published in English (or with English abstracts) were reviewed. The final reference list was generated based on originality and relevance to the broad scope of this Review.\nThe isolation and identification of pathogens were carried out in a certified microbiological laboratory of the Department of Microbiology at the Danylo Halytsky Lviv National Medical University, Ukraine. A Bacteriological Culture Method was used to isolate a pure pathogen culture. Antibiotic Sensitivity Test was made using M100 Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. Microbial cultures were disposed of according to standard laboratory biosafety protocols.\nThe pathogen identification was performed using the MIKRO-LA-TEST ENTERO kit (ErbaLachema) in five technical repetitions and using the corresponding codebook.\nWas aligned the sequenced genomes of members of the Enterobacteriaceae family to compile a phylogenetic tree of the Enterobacteriaceae family (Figure ). The genomes were loaded manually from the GenBank database. Species of the Klebsiella and Raoultella genera were all loaded, considering the completeness of the genomes. For the phylogeny markers identification, the Phylophlan2 program, the improved version of the original Phylophlan software, with the amphora2 database (136 proteins) was used. Default parameters of the Phylophlan2, which we applied, included a diamond algorithm for homology search of the 136 proteins in selected genomes and MAFFT algorithm with auto parameters for aligning newly formed concatemers., For the further construction of phylogeny, the CIPRES supercluster was used, namely, IQTree software with standard settings and the ultrafast bootstrap approximation as a topology reliability criterion (n = 1000).,\nFrom the cladogram (Figure ), we can see that the Raoultella genus bacteria form a distinct group from Klebsiella. Besides, the Klebsiella and Raoultella sequences represent the most distantly related groups when compared with the other bacterial sequences.\nRaoultella terrigena infection can damage different organs (lungs, wounds, and general septic infection), especially in patients with chronic diseases. It was interesting to know in case No. 1 that administration of imipenem during 5 days before biological sampling for inoculation did not affect the inoculation of the pathogen, even though the cultured R. terrigena strain was sensitive to imipenem, suggests a constant source of infection for the patient, which could potentially be due to the device tubes, as previously described by Hurrel et al showing the growth of the pathogen R. terrigena was associated with tubes for newborn feeding.\nIn both cases of this study, R. terrigena isolates were unpretentious to the cultivation conditions; it is cultured on ordinary nutrient media (beef-extract agar, blood agar, but worth growing in Endo (lactose-containing) medium) at 37°C, hemolysis (-), without a specific smell or pigment. Colonies are not specific. Figures and show R. terrigena colony on blood agar. Biochemical identification results are shown in Table .\nThe delayed onset of infection in the patients (ie, at least 48 hours after hospital admission), and the fact that both patients were in the same ICU (at different times) and on the ALV with similar antibiotic response profiles (Table ) suggest the involvement of nosocomial transmission of the infection for the two clinical cases shown here. We speculate that R. terrigena may play an essential role in device-associated nosocomial opportunistic infections.\nA regular study of the microbial landscape among patients in this ICU was not carried out, and the search for a possible source of infection in the department or hospital is not routinely done in these cases and is usually at the discretion of the medical facility where the issue occurs. These two clinical cases discussed here highlight the need to establish in Ukraine a more standardized system to record and investigate nosocomial infections with potentially undesirable public health effects.\nThe Raoultella genus was separated from Klebsiella in 2001 basing on the analysis of 16S rRNA sequences and the rpoβ gene. However, difficulties with the correct identification of the pathogen still arise, which may lead to underestimating its presence and inaccuracies in determining its pathological role. A retrospective study of 240 blood samples from the collection of the Ramón y Cajal University Hospital laboratory in Madrid (Spain, 2015), with bacteria of the Klebsiella genus observed, has shown that 11 of them actually contained bacteria of the Raoultella genus. Raoultella planticola and R. ornithinolytica cause most Raoultella bacteremia cases. Raoultella terrigena and R. electrica species also belong to this genus. Typical habitats for these pathogens are freshwater, plants, and soil. Raoultella acts as a conditionally pathogenic component of the microbiota, in most cases causing bile duct infections. Since the genome of representatives of this genus contains the class A β-lactamase gene, a natural universal resistance to ampicillin is observing for all Raoultella isolates. Now 80 cases of bacteremia secondary to Raoultella spp, with various primary infection sources, are known.\nIn general, these bacteria are sensitive to amoxicillin, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, cephalosporins of 2-4 generations, carbapenem, aminoglycosides, trimethoprim/sulfate methoxazole, and tigecycline. Like Klebsiella, Raoultella can acquire antibiotic resistance genes, leading to an increase of the multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates. Recent work describing infections caused by Raoultella has shown that these bacteria are characterized by various resistance mechanisms, especially those involving sulfonamides and quinolone and antibiotics of the β-lactam spectrum., Resistance genes for such drugs are localized in bacterial plasmids; they are not a constitutive component of their genome.\nThe sensitivity of Raoultella to disinfectants, as well as to antibiotics, was also studied and revealed ambiguous results. In particular, studies on various isolates of R. planticola showed growth retardation under the influence of sodium hypochlorite, benzalkonium chloride, n-hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride, and 1-hexadecylpyridinum chloride. In contrast, the other isolates were resistant to most of the antibiotics, disinfectants, and the effects of metals such as aluminium and heavy metals such as iron, nickel, and others.,\nBacteria of the Raoultella genus do not show a high level of virulence. The main virulence factors of these bacteria are lipopolysaccharides (O-antigen), polysaccharide capsules (K-antigen), adhesins (fimbriae class 1 and class 3), siderophores (enterobactin and aerobactin), tetrodotoxin, different hydrolytic enzymes, bacteriocins, such as raoultellin L Raoultella isolates are also able to form biofilms. It has been shown that processing crops, particularly tomatoes, with a suspension of R. terrigena have antiparasitic activity and can be used in agricultural biotechnology.\nRaoultella terrigena could be isolated from the intestine of pufferfish, milk and may be used in biotechnology as 2,3-Butanediol produser.\nRaoultella terrigena are gram-negative nonmotile capsule forming bacteria belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family. They are facultative anaerobes having both respiratory and enzymatic types of metabolism. Next to R. electrica, infections caused by R. terrigena are rare, and the identification and study of cases of infection with this bacterium are a promising and important area of modern clinical microbiology because the role of R. terrigena in the pathogenesis of disease is underestimated.\nIn 2019, the genome sequencing of two clinical strains of R. terrigena (NCTC 13097 and NCTC 13098) isolated from the mucous membrane of a child's tonsils and a patient with chronic bronchitis was completed. This pathogen's genome size is 5.5-6 Mb, and its GC content is about 57%. One of the strains also contained an 86 kb plasmid. Bioinformatic analysis of the R. terrigena genome identified 5500 protein-coding sequences in addition to 85 tRNA and 25 rRNA sequences.\nThere are 363 reported cases of Raoultella (Klebsiella) terrigena in humans from 1988 to 2021, including 2 report cases in this study. 132 cases (36,3%) of K. terrigena in Germany, 69 cases (19,0%) from Pakistan, 56 cases (15.4%) from Palestine, 36 cases (9,9%) from Ethiopia, 27 cases (7.4%) from Nigeria, and 43 cases (11,8%) from another countries (United Kingdom, Turkey, Iraq, South Korea, Ukraine, Austria, and China (Figure and Table ). In 140 reported cases (38.6%), R. terrigena were MDR. In 13.6% of cases, R. terrigena was isolated from human feces without any clinical symptoms.\nRaoultella terrigena infection showed high mortality (44.4%), 4 patients from 9 separately reported clinical cases with presented outcome information have died (Table ). Similar mortality levels (44.7%) have been reported in Pakistan during 2013-2018 years. In our case, 1 of our study patient had pregnancy, eclampsia, and long-term smoking anamnesis; in case 2, the patient had decompensation of type 1 diabetes, so we may say both patients were immunocompromised.\nRetrospective analysis of isolation of 50 strains of K. terrigena from human feces was provided in 1990 at the University of Kiel (Germany). Still, it was no reported about its clinical significance, so the hypothesis of K. terrigena as a part of normal human microbiota was assumed. And already in 2 years, the same authors reported about 10 clinical cases of K. terrigena infections. 50 cases (feces) of Klebsiella terrigena were isolated from healthy people and 22 cases from clinical cases (15 respiratory secretions, 1 blood culture, 2 urine, and 4 wounds) in 2000 in UK.\nAt present, there are few separately, and detail described cases of R. terrigena infection in the world, which prevent us from establishing a specific clinical symptomatic profile for this pathogen or a clear outline of the disease course, leaving many open questions and information gaps. The variety of possible clinical manifestations does not differ from those that are characteristic of representatives of the Enterobacteriaceae family or Klebsiella genus.\nFrom 1990 to 2021, there have been no reported and described clinical cases of Raoultella terrigena infection in Ukraine. However, an overview of worldwide R. terrigena prevalence, shown in Figure , indicates that some cases of R. terrigena were seen in Europe for that period. Furthermore, Table details R. terrigena infection cases as of 2021, summarizing the patients' clinical history, including the source of infection and treatment regimen. There was no correlation between geography, environmental conditions, seasons of the year, patients, or tissue target in described cases in Table .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A CT scan performed to exclude the possibility of lung injury incidentally detected a bronchopulmonary nodule with a diameter of 14 mm in the apical segment of the right lower lobe (RLL). The patient was otherwise in good health and specifically denied fever or chills. Her past medical history was unremarkable for inherited diseases. Given the radiological characteristics of the nodule and the young age of the patient, prudential follow up-was opted for in the form of an annual chest CT scan. In December 2018, a slight increase was noted in the longest diameter of the bronchopulmonary nodule (16 × 12 mm compared to the previous 14 × 10 mm). 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose- (18FDG-) and 68Gallium (68Ga-) DOTATATE PET/CT scans were performed, revealing an increase in the maximum standardized uptake value of the nodule of 3.5 and 3.4, respectively (Fig. ).\nEndobronchial hamartoma was suspected and, in April 2019, the patient thus underwent videothoracoscopic segmentectomy of the apical segment of RLL with hilar-mediastinal lymphadenectomy. Histopathological examination revealed a complex lesion: the epithelial component showed a well-defined, solid, and acinar architecture without a capsule, with a low degree of malignancy. IHC was positive for CAM5.2, naspin and TTF1, weakly positive for synaptophysin, and negative for chromogranin A, CD56, DOG1 and SOX10. Intense cytoplasmic positivity for PAS was also observed. Eight lymph nodes were negative for metastasis. There was no pleural infiltration. The clinical-morphological and immunophenotypic features were strongly suggestive of salivary gland-like lung cancer.\nAfter surgery, the patient was referred to our cancer cancer for a second opinion and a revision was made of the histopathology diagnosis by another expert pathologist, as per National Rare Tumor Guidelines. The referral described a central area of compact fascicular spindle cells, sometimes with eosinophilic cytoplasm, mixed with numerous inflammatory elements including plasma cells and lymphocytes inserted in dense fibrous stroma. At the edge of the nodule there were numerous epithelial elements, among which cubic cells without atypia or mitosis, which were immunohistochemically-positive for CK7 and napsin and TTF1 (A) and negative for CD117, chromogranin and synaptophysin. Previously considered as neoplastic, these were probably cells that were reactive to the real lesion. There were numerous IgG plasma cells, mainly in peripheral areas, but the IgG4 ratio was normal. The spindle cell component was positive for smooth actin and negative for ALK using Vysis LSI ALK (2p23) Dual Color, Break Apart Rearrangement probe. Ki67 was 5%. These findings were highly suggestive of an IMT (Fig. ).The Soft Tissue Sarcoma Multidisciplinary Board of our institute discussed the case, opting for no adjuvant treatment was decided, and the patient was placed in a 3-monthly follow-up program. The patient has been in clinical follow-up for 24 months, with no signs of recurrent disease (Figure S1, Supplemental Digital Content).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As part of her workup, she underwent a CT scan of her chest, which revealed acute bilateral PE. Given the complexity of the case, the patient was transferred to our institution for advanced therapies. On arrival, her heart rate was 120 bpm and blood pressure was 112/59 mmHg. Her respiratory rate was 14 breaths/minutes and she was saturating 91% on room air. Initial labs revealed an elevated troponin of 2.47 ng/mL (normal: <0.04 ng/mL), lactic acid of 3 mmol/L (normal: <1.7 mmol/L), and BNP of 174 pg/mL (normal: <100 pg/mL). CT pulmonary angiography was repeated, which demonstrated bilateral PE with a large clot burden in the left and right main pulmonary arteries (PAs) (Figure ). Transthoracic echo revealed a RV/LV ratio of 1.53 (normal: <0.9), RVOT VTI of 8 cm (normal: ~17 cm), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) of 21 mm (normal: >17 mm), and S’ velocity of 10 cm/s (normal: >9.5 cm/s), suggestive of RV enlargement and dysfunction. Bubble study demonstrated a patent foramen ovale (PFO) (Figures , ). Doppler studies of the lower extremities were performed due to decreased pulses, which revealed thrombus in the left common femoral artery with near-total occlusion of flow.

She was the youngest daughter of a 49-year-old mother with type 2 DM (T2DM).\nShe was referred by her dietitian for a complaint of five attacks (after midnight hypoglycemia) in the last two weeks. However, she was disease-free with no previous relevant medical or psychiatric history. She enjoyed healthy life, was on a vegetarian diet, and visited a sports gym in the last eight months to decrease her body mass index from 32 kg/m2 to be 21 kg/m2 at presentation, with no drug therapy in any form. She did not experience any dysglycemic event during that period and complied with the monthly doctor visits.\nHer older sister - a fifth-year medical student - shared the room with her, witnessed the events, and was the first-response person to diagnose hypoglycemia, which she was familiar with from her mother. She measured her sister’s capillary blood glucose level by glucometer during the events and found it in the hypoglycemic range that required emergency room (ER) referral and management.\nDuring all events, the patient denied any intake of any culprit medication, especially insulin. In three out of the five events, she experienced persistent hypoglycemic symptoms hours after ER discharge with blood glucose confirmation.\nThe physical examination was non-confirmatory, with no injection marks during a full-body inspection. During the last event, a sample of her venous blood was drawn to measure the serum insulin and C-peptide the next morning, as instructed by the physician on call. Serum insulin was 32.6 µU/mL (normal value: 2.6-24.9 µU/mL, while C-peptide was 1.1 ng/mL (normal value: 0.9-4.3 ng/mL). The patient and her family were advised for careful preparedness for future events. Still, we consider insulin injection even with her denial. Her older sister was instructed to inspect for any hidden medications in their room.\nTwo days later, they came to the clinic after discovering a vial of premixed insulin 30/70 in a small portable cooling container, which was hidden carefully and contained three milliliters only, and a pack of insulin syringes. They were not her mother’s insulin brand or syringes. After the confrontation, the patient confessed:\n“I bought this vial to burn the extra sugar in my body. I had tried to inject three units daily to see its effect and escalated the dose gradually”.\nThis was not convincing, given her indifference to the situation, lack of interest in further investigations, and her body language, which made us suspicious. After insisting, she stated (in tears) that:\n“I injected 18 units of insulin each time to lower my sugar to draw my family's attention to me again. They constantly blamed me for the failure of a marriage proposal that came to me two months ago. They cast me away, but they were around me during these events and accepted me as am I, to do what I want to do”.\nShe was injecting herself at the inguinal regions, at the medial high most of the upper thigh, and the areas hidden by the underwear so that the marks could not be discovered during the former examination. Her older sister confirmed that after seeing multiple injection marks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Having previously consulted primary care services, she was confirmed SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 positive 3 days prior to hospitalisation through community testing. She had followed Scottish COVID-19 lockdown guidance, but she did work directly with the public in a UK supermarket chain that was also taking distancing and protection precautions. She had become short of breath at rest: respiratory rate (RR) 48 breaths per minute and SpO2 85% on air. She described a productive cough and pleuritic chest pain. She also gave a history of intermittent fever, blocked nose and sore throat, bad taste, and reduced appetite. Seventeen hours later, she was admitted to ICU. Her weight had been stable (104 kg BMI 36). She had a history of chronic widespread pain, migraines, fibromyalgia, anxiety, and irritable bowel syndrome. Her medication history was medroxyprogesterone 10 mg, fluoxetine 20 mg, propranolol modified release 80 mg, almotriptan 12.5 mg, and nortriptyline 30 mg. She had never smoked and did not consume alcohol at all. She studied full time at university up until COVID-19 closure and lockdown.\nInitial ward management included supplemental oxygen fraction (FiO2) 35% by a fixed performance mask. Her observations at this stage were SpO2 96%, blood pressure (BP) 138/73 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 118/min, and temperature 38.4°C. She reported feeling better, but she looked unwell from the end of the bed, appearing pale, clammy, and tachypnoeic. Her peripheries were warm with normal heart sounds and no oedema; calves were soft and nontender. She remained unable to complete most sentences. Chest X-ray showed bilateral peripheral nodular opacification, most marked in the left mid zone, in keeping with consolidation (). The arterial blood gas (ABG) confirmed hypoxaemia PaO2 75 mmHg (P:F 215 mmHg), PaCO2 29 mmHg, H+ 34 nmol/L, and base excess -2.8 mmol/L. A prompt referral to critical care was made, and when that consult occurred, SpO2 was maintained at 94-96% with FiO2 40% and the temperature was 38.4°C. C-reactive protein (CRP) was 163 mg/L, and full blood count, liver function and urea, and electrolytes were normal. She had received intravenous amoxicillin. After initial improvement however, she was admitted to our mixed level 2/3 critical care having deteriorated to SpO2 96% on FiO2 60% by a fixed performance mask and RR 35/min unstressed but 38°C with mean arterial pressure (MAP) 60 mmHg. On route to the ICU, a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was performed (). This excluded a pulmonary embolism and confirmed COVID-19 changes with left upper lobe consolidation. On admission into a single occupancy room, an arterial line was sited, intravenous crystalloid in targeted boluses used, HFNO started (Optiflow+ (Fisher & Paykel Healthcare), Courtaboeuf, France; heat and moisture exchanger (HME) filter; MR850 heater humidification device and MR290 autofill chamber (Fisher & Paykel Healthcare); and an air/oxygen blender capable of 100% O2 and up to 70 L/min flow (Bio-Med Devices, Guilford, CT, USA)), and 0.1 mg/kg oral morphine given with encouragement to self-prone. PaO2 was 45 mmHg on 15 L/min O2 (mask) and improved over the first period in intensive care on 60% FiO2 at 60 L/min HFNO with PaO2 65 mmHg, PaCO2 31 mmHg, SpO2 94%, MAP 77 mmHg, and HR 120/min.\nWe aimed for SpO2 > 92%, PaO2 equal or over 60 mmHg, and mean arterial pressure 65 mmHg. Self-prone positioning was encouraged when the P:F ratio was under 150 mmHg (20 kPa). Clarithromycin was added to amoxicillin. Prophylactic low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was prescribed with LMWH (anti-Xa) assay monitoring, aiming for 0.1–0.4 μ/mL. We asked her to lie on her front for as long as possible. She was able to tolerate this most of the time, only turning supine for care, meals, and interventions. We did not stipulate a maximum prone time as the advantage of being awake is that patients can self-adjust pressure areas as well as engage more fully with physiotherapy and nursing intervention.\nOn day 2, the HFNO was titrated between 40 and 70 L/min. The trend in FiO2, SpO2, PaO2, and P:F ratio throughout her time in critical care shows improvement and fluctuation with time self-prone (). Typically, her observations were stable at RR 34/min, SpO2 95%, PaO2 157 mmHg, and PaCO2 35 mmHg with self-prone positioning and her PaO2 was under 60 mmHg when supine. She would desaturate to a low SpO2 80%-88% range on movement for nursing care. The use of the broad-spectrum antimicrobial cover was continued in line with daily microbiologist input. On day 3, the HFNO support was reduced to 40–50 L/min, FiO2 40%, RR 22/min, and SpO2 91%. Remaining prone (P:F ratio 140 mmHg, PaO2 56 mmHg), she was comfortable, afebrile, RR 18-24/min, alert, and orientated. Her heart rate had settled to 67 bpm and BP 114/65. She continued to self-prone through day 4. Part of the success of this strategy was to ensure her comfort with measures such as extra pillows under pressure points of her pelvis. She remained in positive spirits, and overall, she found the patient interface of HFNO acceptable and did not like the idea of CPAP or invasive ventilation. On day 5, she completed co-amoxiclav, HFNO flow was reduced to a minimum, and FiO2 was 40%; eventually, she was liberated from HFNO onto a 24-28% fixed performance oxygen mask. On day 6, she was discharged back to infectious diseases having not been intubated. She reported feeling physically much better but remained anxious and found it difficult to process the events of the last few days. She remained tired and lethargic but subjectively less short of breath, and all chest pain had resolved. By day 7, tiredness and the cough were the main complaints but the cough was now nonproductive. Assistance was required when walking to the toilet. Mobility gradually improved. Psychiatry was consulted and felt that she seemed to have coped well with being in the hospital, including ICU, but had raised concern about remembering any new detail that may become hard to process pertaining to this spell of hospitalisation and ill health. Strategies for managing this were provided. On day 9, with RR 19/min, SpO2 98% on room air, BP 101/67 mmHg, HR 104/min, temperature 36.5°C, and feeling well, she was discharged home.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical investigations and X-rays (digital radiological device TOP 30 HF 400 mA–99 kV) suspected the presence of a mass located in the retrobulbar space of the right eye. A transorbital ultrasound was proposed to confirm the diagnosis but was not accepted by the owner, as well as the proposed CT scan to better diagnose the mass and for a correct staging of it. The regional palpable lymph node was cytologically negative.\nThe first clinical examination on March 2019 revealed a normal sensory state, a mild grade of dehydration (3%), body temperature 38.2 °C, normal mucous membranes, refill time <2 s, cardiac rate 92 bpm, respiratory rate 38 breaths per minute, normal results for thoracic auscultation and abdominal palpation. The blood pressure measured by Doppler device was 180 mm Hg, but the cat was not cooperative. The hematological investigations revealed a lower reticulocyte hemoglobin value (11.8 pg) (Procyte Idexx), a hyperglycemic condition with a glucose value of about 196 mg/dL and an increased value of the glutamine pyruvic transaminase serum (ALT or SGPT)-175 U/L (Catalist Idexx).\nThe owners decided to subject the animal to surgery for the enucleation of the right eye and its subocular mass.\nTransconjunctival enucleation of the ocular globe and removal of the retrobulbar mass were proposed, performing a lateral canthotomy and a 360° peritomy. An incision of the insertions of the extraocular muscles near the sclera was performed, until the retrobulbar mass was highlighted and the portion was clamped vascular. The orbital cavity was then filled with a hemostatic sponge, and the third eyelid and the conjunctiva were removed, then the eyelid margins were cut for a correct closure of the surgical wound (). Sedation of the patient was performed with medetomidine and methadone IM, anesthetic induction with propofol IV, maintenance with isofluorane and fentanest in CRI, and upon awakening buprenorphine and meloxicam were administered with a cefazoin IV administration half an hour before induction. The patient awakened in a cage with a heated mattress and infrared lamp.\nThe second clinical examination, after the surgery, performed in May 2019, revealed an aggravated status of the cat, characterized by strong depression, anorexia, weight loss 3.4 Kg (2/5 BCS), dehydration, sialorrhea, vomiting, purulent discharge from the right nostril, widespread muscle pain, dysphagia, generalized tremors, ataxia. The patient was hospitalized and treated with saline solution IV, dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg), lincomycin (11 mg/kg), maropitant (2 mg/kg), omeprazole (1 mg/kg), tramadol (2 mg/kg). The hematological investigations were characterized by erythrocytosis (12.63 M/μL), Red blood cells Distribution Width (RDW) (33.1%), low levels of eosinophils and platelets (0.07 and 92 KμL), glucose value of about 203 mg/dL.

The patient described a history of a single acute episode with pain in the upper anterior teeth that lasted for about 2 days, which had occurred more than 2 years ago. Since then, no provoked or spontaneous pain had occurred, and no signs of swelling had been noticed by the patient until this recent episode.\nIntra-oral clinical examination revealed a round to oval swelling, which was located in the anterior right maxillary sulcus, extended onto the buccal labial oral mucosa, and related to both the central and lateral right upper incisors, teeth #11 and #12. The swelling was soft, localized, inflamed, and non-tender to palpation. Significant mesial and distal decay of tooth #11 and discoloration were also observed. Smaller carious lesions and no discoloration were observed on tooth #12.\nPulp vitality testing using cold ice showed a negative response only for tooth #11 and a normal response for tooth #12. A negative response was also obtained for tooth #11 for both warm and electric pulp testing. Both teeth presented no tenderness in the long axis percussion test. Periodontal probing was within normal limits for both incisors and the gingiva was intact. The patient had already been subjected to a CBCT investigation with the parameters 11 × 5 cm field of view, 150 µm voxel size, 90 kV, 14 mA, and 5.07 s emission, being a referral case, so the CBCT was analyzed for a precise diagnostic by the endodontist. The images were displayed on a 24” Dell Flat Panel Monitor (Dell, Bucharest, Romania) with 1920 × 1080 pixels resolution. A large unilocular radiolucent lesion, which involved the periapical region of tooth #11, extending distally up to the lateral incisor, without involving its apex, mesially to the middle line of the maxilla, and up to the nasal fossa, with an intact nasal floor, was diagnosed. The size of the lesion was measured using the measurement tools of the Planmeca Romexis software (Planmeca, Helsinki, Finland), and it was about 9 mm in height, 9 mm in the buccolingual direction, and 10 mm in the mesiodistal direction. The lesion appeared well outlined, with a thin radiopaque border on all its contours, but communicated with the apex of the central incisor in its inferior part (a–c).\nFrom the history, clinical examination, and radiographic investigation, a diagnosis of pulpal necrosis of tooth #11 complicated with a cystic-like periapical lesion (presumptive pocket cyst) in an acute phase (abscess) was established. Tooth #12 was considered vital with a healthy pulp, responding normally to the cold vitality test, and non-affected by the size of the lesion.\nA non-surgical endodontic treatment for tooth #11 was decided on, as being the most conservative procedure, with the continuous monitoring of the lesion at follow-up. The treatment plan was explained to the patient, and her informed consent was taken.\nAn access cavity was initiated with a high-speed bur along the long axis of the tooth under rubber dam isolation, and immediately a pus discharge was observed. Microsurgical tips were used connected to the suction device of the dental unit to stimulate the drainage. After determination of the working length using hand K-files attached to a Raypex® 6 apex locator (VDW GmbH, Munich, Germany), canals were shaped using a WaveOne® Gold system (Dentsply Sirona, Ballaigues, Switzerland), instrument Medium 35/06, using a crown-down technique with the help of a VDW Silver Reciproc motor (VDW). Abundant irrigation with sodium hypochlorite solution NaClO 5.25% (Chloraxid 5.25%, CERKAMED, Wojciech Pawłowski, Poland) was used from the beginning of the access cavity, alternating with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution EDTA 17% (Endo-Solution 17%, CERKAMED) during the root canal instrumentation. Thirty seconds of ultrasonic activation of the NaClO 5.25% solution was applied at the end with an IrriSafeTM ultrasonic tip K25 (Acteon Satelec, Merignac, France) connected to a piezoelectric ultrasound unit Satelec Suprasson P5 Booster (Acteon Satelec) at a low power setting (3, green) with a vibration frequency of 30 KHz, according to the manufacturer. As the drainage could not be stopped at the end of the treatment and the canal was still wet, calcium hydroxide paste (Calcipast, CERKAMED) was used as an intra-canal medication for the next three weeks.\nAt the second appointment, the medication was removed, the tooth was re-irrigated and dried, and the obturation was completed with the continuous wave of condensation technique (CWC), using a resin-based sealer (AH Plus Jet®, Dentsply Sirona) and Wave One Gold gutta-percha points, and with the help of a EQ-V obturation system (Meta Biomed® Europe GmbH, Mülheim and der Ruhr, Germany). The tooth was adhesively restored with direct composite in the same appointment. No surgical decompression was necessary to lower the pressure and drain the exudate, because the canal was dried in the second appointment and could be obturated.\nPost-operative instructions were given to the patient, and she was kept under observation. At the 2-week check-up, a significant reduction in size of the swelling was observed, with no symptomatology of the patient, and after a further month, the swelling had completely disappeared; an increased resistance at palpation in the buccal apical region of the tooth #11 was noticed. After three months, a palpable portion of the buccal bone in the central incisor’s region was observed. At the 6-months follow up, only a control periapical radiograph was taken and a major decrease of the cyst-like lesion, with almost complete healing and formation of new trabecular bone, were observed (d).\nThe patient was recalled at 12 months, and another CBCT with parameters 5 × 5 cm field of view, 85 µm voxel size, 90 kV, 6.3 mA, and 8.70 s emission was performed in the dental clinic to observe the evolution of the lesion. The OnDemand3D (OP 3D™ Pro, KaVo Dental GmbH, Biberach, Germany) program was used for analysis and new measurements on the same computer screen. In all three sections, the lesion appeared almost completely healed; the buccal and alveolar bone were completely restored and the contour of the periodontal ligament was normal, with a small area of enlargement, of only 1.5 mm, around the apex of the tooth (e–h). Tooth #12 was still vital, with a normal response. At present, the patient has no symptomatology, the tooth is functional, and the 18-month control will follow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gynecological history was significant for menarche at the age of 13, regular monthly menses, and a history of treated chlamydia. She had a history of congenital pulmonary stenosis treated with 2 angioplasties and hypertension managed with losartan. Her most recent echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 60-65% and no significant valvular disease.\nOn examination, she was 165 cm tall and weighed 58 kg with a BMI of 21 kg/m2. Her vital signs were normal. A pelvic exam showed an anteverted, 8-week size uterus. Transvaginal ultrasound revealed a uterus measuring 7.1 cm length × 8.1 cm width × 4.6 cm depth with normal appearing ovaries. On 3D transvaginal ultrasound, the uterine septum had a 2 cm deep indentation with an angle of 65° (). A hysterosalpingogram showed two uterine cornua with normal appearing and patent fallopian tubes (). Laboratory studies were unremarkable and included an estradiol level of 81 pg/mL, a follicle stimulating hormone level of 2.8 mIU/mL, a luteinizing hormone level of 11.1 mIU/mL, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level of 0.860 μIU/mL.\nShe conceived her first pregnancy spontaneously 2 months after the hysterosalpingogram was performed. Part of the uterine septum can be seen on an 18-week obstetrical ultrasound performed in this first pregnancy (). During her first pregnancy, she was diagnosed with preeclampsia with severe features at 37 weeks of gestation at an outside hospital. An ECV was performed, followed by induction of labor and an uncomplicated vaginal delivery.\nThe patient then conceived her second pregnancy spontaneously 4 months after her first delivery. She received prenatal care by an outside clinic that does not offer ECVs and was referred to our obstetrical triage unit for the procedure. On presentation to our hospital, she was a 20-year-old gravida 2 para 1001 at 37 weeks and 6 days of gestational age with confirmed breech presentation and a posterior placenta. The estimated fetal weight by ultrasound was 3003 grams, and maximum vertical amniotic fluid pocket was 5.7 cm. Risks and benefits of an ECV were discussed with the patient, and consent was obtained. At 38 weeks and 0 days, an ECV was performed in the operating room under epidural anesthesia with administration of 0.25 mg subcutaneous terbutaline. The fetus was in frank breech position with the fetal head in the maternal right upper quadrant and back facing up and to the maternal left. The fetal rump was elevated out of the pelvis while pressure was simultaneously applied to the fetal head to direct it towards the pelvis. The ECV was successful on the second attempt, and anti-D immune globulin was administered after the procedure.\nAfter the ECV, the patient was discharged home and scheduled to return for induction of labor at 39 weeks 0 days. When she returned for induction of labor, breech position was again observed by ultrasound. An epidural was placed, ECV was performed again in the operating room easily and without complications, and the patient was transferred to labor and delivery for induction of labor. During labor, the patient was diagnosed with preeclampsia with severe blood pressures and started on magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis.\nA singleton male in cephalic position was delivered vaginally at 39 weeks 2 days of gestation weighing 3510 grams with Apgar scores of 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes. After delivery of the fetus and placenta, there were retained membranes that did not deliver with gentle traction. Manual uterine exploration revealed membranes firmly adhered in the right cornu which was felt to have contracted around the membranes holding them in place. The membranes were removed manually with traction. Manual uterine exploration afterwards revealed a thick uterine septum consistent with previous 3D TVUS and hysterosalpingogram findings. The postpartum course was uncomplicated, and another dose of anti-D immune globin was administered on postpartum day 2 since the infant was Rh positive. The mother and infant were both discharged on postpartum day 2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nataSHA WeAVer dvM,18,F,AB+,Arthritis,03-08-2022,Amber Hernandez,"and King, Fuller Chavez",Medicare,47288.34328,467,Urgent,04-08-2022,Paracetamol,Inconclusive,"An 18-year-old female high school student without a history of psychiatric disorder was admitted to our day-care clinic at the Central Institute of Mental Health (CIMH), Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University (). On admission, she complained that she “is not the same person, [she] used to be before.” Being a very ambitious, self-confident student and a competitive athlete, she started to become increasingly insecure and was confronted with unusual self-doubts. During her last school vacation (~6 weeks before admission), the relationship with her boyfriend ended abruptly.\nFollowing her return to school after vacation, she developed unfamiliar exam nerves. She was sitting in front of her assignments and having the impression that her “thoughts were blocked.” She was continually ruminating over her condition and feared that she would never be “the same” again. She showed depressed mood and markedly diminished interest in almost all activities as well as substantially reduced drive and social interaction, which was associated with the concern that “people might notice, how bad [her] condition is.” This culminated in an inability to leave the house at all. Occasionally, she had the impression that people were talking about her condition. It occurred briefly a few times prior to admission, and upon request, she considered it highly unlikely that this happened in reality.\nOn admission, we saw a well-dressed and well-groomed young woman. During the interview, she was slightly restless and presented a cautious and mildly suspicious attitude toward the examiner and a marked ambivalence regarding the treatment. Nevertheless, she remained cooperative and friendly most of the time. She was in a depressed mood, and her affect showed no modulation and reactivity throughout the interview. Markedly diminished interest in almost all activities and substantially reduced drive and social interaction were reported. The flow of thought was slow and thought blocking was rarely observed and self-experienced. The thought process itself remained generally coherent. Thought pressure was reported. Besides some occasional unstable ideas of reference, the thought content was unremarkable, with no evidence of delusions, hallucination, or self-disorder. There was also no evidence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. She was oriented and showed a marked reduction in attention and concentration. Short-term memory showed mild disturbances, while long-term memory was unaffected. Reduced appetite, libido, and sleep disturbances were reported. The young woman clearly and consistently denied any form of suicidal ideation.\nThere was neither a history of drug abuse nor of a previous episode of a mental disorder. However, the young woman reported a history of mental health issues in her family. Her father and her aunt (paternal) suffered from a major depressive episode; her grandfather (paternal) had post-stroke depression. As a preexisting medical condition, hypothyroidism was stated.\nWe diagnosed severe major depression (MDD) according to the ICD-10. Based on the aforementioned mental status examination, some attenuated positive symptoms (marked suspicion and unstable ideas of reference) and basic symptoms (thought blockade and thought pressure) according to the Early Recognition Inventory (ERIraos) () could be detected. However, those symptoms never reached the threshold for psychosis, and severe depressive symptoms dominated the overall clinical picture (). Results of further clinical examinations and initial blood tests were within the normal range, besides iatrogenic hyperthyroidism. The initial cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no pathological findings. We continued the already initiated administration of escitalopram (5 mg) and lorazepam (1.5 mg/d) and increased the dose of escitalopram stepwise to 15 mg and lorazepam up to 6.5 mg daily. We further reduced the initial dose of 150 μg of L-thyroxin to 100 μg due to the increased thyroid hormone levels. The young woman showed a marked improvement after the administration of lorazepam, especially regarding the thought process disturbances and cognitive deficits. The young woman consented to a lumbar puncture, revealing a subtle pleocytosis and anti-NMDAR AAbs (titer 1:4) in CSF. She was subsequently referred to the Department of Neurology of the University Medicine Mannheim, Faculty Mannheim of Heidelberg University (UMM), where some diagnostic procedures were repeated. The follow-up MRI at UMM did not reveal pathological findings (). Several consecutive EEG recordings were within the normal range. The repeated CSF examination confirmed the presence of anti-NMDAR AAbs (titer 1:8) and pleocytosis (eight cells). Notably, no anti-NMDAR AAbs were detected in serum. A further comprehensive neuroimmunological, viral, and microbiological examination did not result in any additional pathological findings. A whole-body MRI did not reveal any potential origin of a possible para-neoplastic genesis of the underlying condition.\nSubsequently, the young woman received a 5-day course of intravenous immunoglobulins treatment (Privigen® 40 g/d; 200 mg in total). Two weeks after the intravenous immunoglobulin administration, the patient was referred back to our psychiatric department at CIMH. After readmission, we saw a significant improvement in the clinical state, although marked depressive and cognitive symptoms remained. We repeated an EEG during the tapering off phase of the initially high dose of lorazepam. In contrast to the previous regular EEG recordings, an intermittent epileptogenic activity was detected (generalized irregular spikes and sharp waves, additionally desynchronize alpha-rhythm (7–10 Hz) with a high amplitude (60–150 μV), occasionally theta-rhythm) (). Consequently, an anticonvulsive treatment with lamotrigine (initially 25 mg/d) was started. The patient and her parents decided to discontinue the psychiatric treatment at CIMH and sought the second opinion of a neuroimmunology specialist at the Department of Neurology, University Hospital of Heidelberg. Her condition was continuously improving, and approximately 7 weeks after her discharge from CIMH, she was able to resume her studies. From March until July 2016, she received monthly immunoglobulin treatments as an outpatient of the Department of Neurology, University Hospital of Heidelberg. She recovered completely without any sequelae and successfully completed her high school certificate (Abitur) the following year. At a follow-up 5 years post-treatment, she was still in good health without any relapse of the disease so far.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cheRyl larSOn,18,F,A+,Asthma,29-07-2019,James Suarez,Ford-Jackson,Blue Cross,42637.20861,454,Emergency,23-08-2019,Paracetamol,Inconclusive,"In 2014, an 18-year-old female visited Incheon St. Mary’s Hospital (A) because of fatigue. She was diagnosed with hypothyroidism from Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, and her serum TSH was 66.18 mIU/L, and free T4 was 0.51 ng/dL. Based on her body weight of 75 kg, 75 μg/day (1 μg/kg/day) of LT4 was started, but TSH was persistently high and amenorrhea occurred. The LT4 dose was gradually increased and finally reached 800 μg/day, but her TSH level failed to be normalized (). Despite a combination of liothyronine and LT4 with corresponding dose of 300 μg/day of LT4, her TSH and free T4 were also not normalized; TSH level was 369.45 mIU/L, and free T4 was 0.2 ng/dL.\nUnder hypothyroid status, the patient was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and took estradiol and progesterone for a short period and very irregularly. However, before and after administration of hormone therapy, the patient retained her hypothyroid status, which could make the effect of estrogen on LT4 malabsorption excluded. Her body weight change () also could not explain the aberrantly high LT4 dose. Except PCOS, there was no past medical, family, and psychosocial history correlated with thyroid function and gastrointestinal absorption disorder. She had no other relevant previous intervention than LT4 administration for hypothyroidism.\nIn 2018, the patient was referred to Seoul National University Hospital (B). She was taking 600 μg/day of LT4, her body weight was 80.0 kg. Her TSH was 29.85 mIU/L, and free T4 was 0.7 ng/dL. She denied pregnancy and gastrointestinal symptoms involving dysphagia, abdominal discomfort, vomiting, and diarrhea. She also had no symptoms related with lactose intolerance. Laboratory screening tests showed normal range; hemoglobin 12.1 g/dL (12-16 g/dL), albumin 4.7 g/dL (3.3-5.2 g/dL), calcium 9.8 mg/dL (8.8-10.5 mg/dL), phosphorus 4.4 mg/dL (2.5-4.5 mg/dL), CRP 0.14 mg/dL (0-0.5 mg/dL), WBC 10,540/μL (4,000-10,000/μL), and platelet 315,000/μL (130,000-400,000/μL). Liver and renal function were intact: aspartate transaminase 29 IU/L (1-40 IU/L), alanine transferase 43 IU/L, PT INR 0.90 (0.8-1.2), BUN 14 mg/dL (10-26 mg/dL), creatinine 0.97 mg/dL (0.7-1.4 mg/dL), and MDRD eGFR 71.5 mL/min/1.73. Gastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy with biopsy ruled out inflammatory bowel disease, Helicobacter pylori infection, and celiac disease. Capsule endoscopy and abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed nonspecific mild small bowel thickening which was confirmed by an enterologist as less possibility of organic gastrointestinal malabsorptive disorder. All these results supported that there was low possibility of organic gastrointestinal absorptive disorder. Both lung area covered in abdominal CT also showed normal presentation and cystic fibrosis was excluded.\nLT4 absorption test was done by one day-administration of 1,000 μg of LT4 and absorption rate was calculated by the equation using total T4, free T4, and volume of distribution (). After loading LT4 1000 μg at Day 1, TSH and total T4 were measured at baseline, 1 hour, and 2 hours after LT4 ingesting. The equation used for LT4 absorption rate was the following;\nBecause total T4 was not checked after loading of LT4 1,000 μg, re-loading of LT4 was done after 2 days. The test showed the absorption rate of 8.4% (), and true malabsorption status of LT4 without obvious organic problems was confirmed.\nTo analyze ileal thyroid hormone transporters’ expression, the ileal sample of the patient was obtained from her terminal ileum and ascending colon. For control tissues, formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples of 63 consecutive subjects aged 50 years or less were selected by retrospective review of colon cancer patients who underwent total colectomy from 2010 to 2012 at Seoul National University Hospital. Finally, 20 FFPE pairs of terminal ileum and ascending colon were obtained after exclusion of previous history of thyroid diseases, any medication including antibiotics or probiotics within 4 weeks before biopsy or surgery (n=32), gastrointestinal absorption disorder or abdominal surgery (n=7), or unavailable FFPEs (n=4). Controls consisted of 14 men and 6 women, and the mean age was 41 ± 6 years. For this retrospective review of FFPE, the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Hospital (No. H-1506-047-679). The case patient signed her informed consent, and the consent for controls were waived according to the approved protocol by the ethics committee of the institution and based on Helsinki declaration.\nThe 2mm-sized core was obtained in each block of terminal ileum and ascending colon of controls after confirming normal histology by one pathologist, and was subjected to tissue microarray (Superbiochips, Seoul, Korea). Immunohistochemistry was performed in FFPE samples of the patient and tissue microarray of controls for OATP1C1 (1:200 dilution; Abcam Cat # ab234729, RRID: none), OATP2B1(1:200 dilution; Novus Cat # NBP1-80979, RRID : AB_11038565), MCT8 (1:500 dilution; Novus Cat # NBP1-89196, RRID: none), MCT10 (1:50 dilution; Novus Cat # NBP1-80700, RRID : AB_11011163), LAT1 (1:50 dilution; Abcam Cat # ab208776, RRID: none), and LAT2 (1:50 dilution; Novus Cat # NBP1-47989, RRID: none).\nIn terminal ileum, the staining patterns of OATP1C1, OATP2B1, and MCT10 were similar between control and the patient (). LAT1 and LAT2 were stained at brush border in controls, but both were not stained at brush border in the case patient - the staining was limited to nucleus or perinuclear area (). MCT8 was mainly expressed at brush border in controls (). Due to the lack of remnant tissue, the expression of MCT8 in terminal ileum could not be checked in the patient.\nAs LT4 was known to be absorbed mainly in jejunum and ileum (), the functional importance of colonic transporters is unclear. However, because colonic FFPE sample of the patient was available, we also investigated the expressions of transporters in colonic epithelium to know the expression pattern was comparable with ileum, and found similar expression patterns. The staining patterns of OATP1C1, OATP2B1, and MCT10 were similar in both groups, as was terminal ileum (). Like terminal ileum, LAT1 and LAT2 were stained at brush border of control and LAT2 was also stained at nucleus. In the patient, the membranous expression of LAT1 and LAT2 was decreased as in terminal ileum (). MCT8 was expressed in brush border in control, which was similar to ileum, but was expressed in both nucleus and brush border in the patient ().\nIn order to check whether the expression of thyroid hormone transporters in ileum and colon is parallel, the expression pattern of LT4 transporters in large-scale healthy population was confirmed via Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data (). We downloaded gene transcript per million (TPM) values from GTEx data consortium v8 data (dbGaP Accession phs000424.v8.p2) and each sample was annotated based on the sample information provided by GTEx portal. For data visualization, we used 359 stomach, 187 terminal ileum, 373 sigmoid colon and 406 transverse colon samples and TPM values were log-transformed. All plots were generated with the ‘ggplot2’ package implemented in R, and the expression pattern was similar in stomach, terminal ileum, transverse colon, and sigmoid colon in each transporter.\nCurrently, she is maintaining her euthyroid status by taking 9.1 - 10.0 μg/kg/day of LT4 depending on her body weight – 800 μg/day for 80 kg (10 μg/kg/day), 700μg/day for 76.9 kg (9.1 μg/kg/day), 600 μg/day for 64 kg (9.4 μg/kg/day) – which is about 6 times higher than usual dose of 1.6 μg/kg/day ().",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She has a longstanding history of psychiatric inpatient hospitalizations for suicidal and non-suicidal self-injurious behavior, mood lability, and aggression. Upon admission, her medications were olanzapine 10mg three times daily (TID) for psychosis, valproate extended-release (ER) 500mg TID for mood, and lorazepam 0.5mg TID for aggression. Clozapine 25mg twice daily (BID) was initiated due to the patient’s history of failed trials with first-generation antipsychotics (FGA) and SGA. This dosage of clozapine was titrated up to 150mg BID over seven days in increments of 25mg. Two longer-acting injectables (LAIs) antipsychotics in intramuscular (IM) formulation were added for worsening psychosis. So, the patient was on three antipsychotics for treatment-resistant schizophrenia: clozapine 150mg BID, haloperidol decanoate 200mg IM every four weeks, and paliperidone 234mg IM every four weeks.\nOn day 22 of clozapine use, the patient developed symptoms of constipation. As per medical consult, polyethylene glycol 17mg BID and prune juice with meals daily were added and did not improve her symptoms. Nursing reports indicated that the patient had adequate food and fluid intake; however, she continued to complain of abdominal pain and bloating. The patient was then started on bisacodyl 1mg daily, without sufficient relief. On day 36, her abdominal x-ray revealed stool throughout her colon without any bowel distension or obstruction. CIC was suspected as the patient had a total score of 5 on the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale []. She was then managed with two doses of magnesium citrate enema 150ml, allowing her to have normal bowel transit within six hours.

Her arthritis correlated with increased ESR. Her treatment included non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (naproxen, sulindac, meloxicam), followed by methotrexate (initially oral, then subcutaneous). She transferred her care to another institution for 2 years, where she began etanercept with methotrexate. She had a brief remission 3 years into her initial diagnosis. A routine MRI of her elbow then showed active synovitis and new erosions, with recommendation for escalation to another biologic therapy (adalimumab). However, she had severe localized pain with injections, prompting the family to explore stem cell therapy abroad. She transferred back to our institution due to disagreement about therapies and parental concern about the high PGA of 6/10.\nDespite counseling against untested therapies abroad by the rheumatology team, the family found a regenerative medicine clinic outside of the US and she underwent an umbilical cord MSC transplant at the age of 16 years old. The transplant involved three intravenous infusions over 4 days with cells derived from donor human umbilical cord tissue-derived MSC (120 × 106 MSCs; 1.8 × 106 MSCs/kg/dose). The transplant physician instructed the patient to wean off her rheumatic medications prior to the transfusion. She had no initial side effects, though developed a migratory arthritis flare 5 weeks post-transplantation which was attributed to a Herxheimer reaction by the transplant physician. No other minor or serious adverse effects were reported.\nAn MRI of her left elbow 5 months post-transplantation revealed continued progression of erosive changes. Post-transplantation labs remained unchanged, but there was a normalization of her ESR. One year after her initial transplant she again traveled for a second MSC intravenous transfusion (120.6 × 106 cells; 1.9 × 106 MSCs/kg/dose) due to continued elbow arthritis. She developed flu-like symptoms with this treatment. Follow-up 3 months later showed worsening elbow contracture and arthritis on MRI, though no worsening of erosions. She had an intra-articular steroid injection to the elbow joint the following month with marked improvement in her symptoms. Family decided to stop all conventional immunosuppressive therapy and initiate a complement of holistic management including monthly hyperbaric oxygen and red-light therapy with in-home lymphatic draining twice weekly and daily pulsed electromagnetic field therapy.

Retrospective crossmatch results were negative for both donor T and B lymphocytes. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) status was positive in both the donor and the recipient. Early postoperative complications included a left foot drop and vocal cord palsy, which were treated with extensive physical therapy and a left vocal cord injection. One-month surveillance bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) demonstrated no evidence of acute cellular rejection, and circulating DSAs were not detected.\nIn July 2017, follow-up monitoring revealed the development of de novo DSA (DQ2 2,082 MFI). The patient received 1 dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (200 mg/kg) and subsequently developed signs and symptoms of aseptic meningitis. Her immunosuppressive regimen was optimized by increasing the dose of mycophenolate mofetil (500 mg BID to 750 mg BID), which reduced DSA (<1,000 MFI); allograft function at this time was normal (forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1] 2.14 L, 85% predicted). She continued to have serial DSA analysis (), which showed mainly class II DSAs with low MFIs. She continued to receive IVIG infusions (200 mg/kg) monthly and maintained good allograft function.\nIn December 2018, 19 months after transplant, she was admitted to the hospital with lung parenchymal ground-glass opacities on CT scan of the chest and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Circulating DSAs were detected but had a low MFI (DQ2 1,082 MFI). The patient was treated with intravenous corticosteroids (3 doses, 250 mg/kg) and, subsequently, antithymocyte globulin (ATG) (1.5 mg/kg, as tolerated, 3 doses). Although the decline in lung function temporarily plateaued after ATG, the patient was readmitted 2 months later with worsening hypoxemia and hypercapnia, eventually requiring veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support and redo bilateral lung transplant 23 months after her first transplant.\nThe bilateral lung redo transplant was complicated by intraoperative hemorrhage requiring massive transfusion (22 units of packed red blood cells, 26 units of platelets, and 20 units of cryoprecipitate) and grade 3 primary graft dysfunction. Virtual and retrospective cross-match results were negative for T and B lymphocytes; however, circulating DSAs toward DQ7 (2000 MFI) were detected. The patient required prolonged mechanical ventilation and extensive rehabilitation before discharge two months after redo transplant.\nIn July 2019, circulating DSAs against the HLA of the first donor antigens, HLA A23 (785 MFI), were detected in the setting of reduced lung function (FEV1 1.39 L, 55% predicted). In October 2019, follow-up monitoring revealed circulating DSAs to several HLA class II antigens of the second donor, including DR8 (642 MFI), DR11 (1,380 MFI), DR52 (1,218 MFI), DQ4 (1,629 MFI), DQ5 (1,221 MFI), DP3 (809 MFI), and DPA1∗01 (780 MFI). The patient was treated with plasmapheresis (1.5 plasma volume with half fresh-frozen plasma and half albumin, 5 rounds). From July 2019 to December 2019, her pulmonary function gradually improved from 1.39 L to a peak of 1.62 L (64% predicted); her chest CT scan was unremarkable. illustrates the patient's pulmonary function after both her primary and redo transplant.\nIn January 2020, the patient presented with dyspnea, a decline in lung function, and new CT chest findings of bilateral consolidations with scattered noncalcified nodules. She was hospitalized, had a bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy and BAL that demonstrated no evidence of acute cellular rejection or infection, and had a repeat serum DSA analysis that showed persistent DSAs to the second donor lung (DQ4 [1,296 MFI], DR11 [505 MFI], and DP3 [557 MFI]). In addition to DSAs against the second donor, she also had DSAs directed against the following mismatched antigens of the first donor allograft: DR7 (18,553 MFI), A3 (5,740 MFI), A26 (2,299 MFI), B49 (3,672 MFI), and DQ2 (7,621 MFI). Given her symptoms, changes on chest CT, and need for supplemental oxygen, she was treated for probable AMR with plasmapheresis, IVIG (200 mg/kg), and ATG (1.5 mg/kg, as tolerated, 3 doses). The patient gradually improved over the following week and was discharged home on room air. She continued outpatient plasmapheresis and IVIG for CLAD caused by AMR (restrictive allograft syndrome [RAS] phenotype). Despite these aggressive interventions, the patient developed a progressively worsening restrictive ventilatory defect and hypoxemia, which ultimately led to her transition to hospice and untimely death.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The implant had been placed in the medial arm, but after the procedure the patient had suffered from pain, localized swelling, and ecchymosis. At an outpatients follow-up consultation to review the case, the patient exhibited paresthesia, progressive loss of finger flexion strength, and hypoesthesia in the field of the left median nerve. The gynecology team therefore decided to remove the device prematurely during the postoperative outpatients follow-up visit.\nThe gynecology team reported that during initial surgical manipulation they found removal of the device to be extremely difficult, using a surgical approach via the medial aspect of the arm at the proximal extremity of the implant, and decided to abort the procedure. Afterwards, the patient experienced significant localized pain and was unable to fully extend her arm, which was swollen. A pulsating mass was observed, and distal paresthesia was detected. At this point, on the same day as the attempted removal, the vascular surgery team was called in, because of a suspected brachial pseudoaneurysm (). Physical examination revealed a pulsating mass in the medial aspect of the distal third of the patient’s arm. The SCI could not be located by palpation, probably because of the volume of local hematoma. Color Doppler ultrasound showed a pseudoaneurysm in the medial aspect of the brachial artery, with thrombi in the wall, diameters of 4.2 cm x 3.5 cm, a 6 mm neck, and turbulent flow ().\nImmediate open surgical intervention was initiated to repair the injury, in view of the neurological involvement. The procedure was performed under local anesthesia and mild sedation, via a medial incision in the arm. The injury to the brachial artery was identified and local compression of the nerve was observed. The arterial orifice was sutured and the local hematoma was evacuated. In immediate postoperative recovery, the patient presented strong and symmetrical distal pulses, adequate perfusion, and unimpaired distal motricity and sensitivity.\nDuring follow-up, the patient recovered within 14 days with total remission of pain and recovery of motor capacity, full extension of the forearm, and no flexion deficit, paresthesia, or hypoesthesia of the fingers.

At the age of 6.10 years, she presented to the rheumatological clinic with episodes of muscle spasm, leg pain, recurrent fever, intermittent abdominal pain and diarrhea. Laboratory evaluation revealed no remarkable findings. Ten months later, she was admitted to our medical center due to severe hypocalcemia (4.5 mg/dL; normal range, 8.1–10.6), elevated phosphorus (9.11 mg/dL; normal range, 2.5–4.5) and undetectable serum parathyroid hormone levels (less than 1 pg/mL; normal range, 12–65). These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of acquired hypoparathyroidism. On examination, she had oral candidiasis and vitiligo on the knees, left elbow, and around the mouth and eyes. Presence of the two major components of the disease (hypoparathyroidism and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis) and one minor component (vitiligo) resulted in a clinical diagnosis of APECED. Administration of calcium supplement (40 mg/kg elemental calcium daily) and α-hydroxycholecalciferol (alpha D3; 0.25 µg daily) was initiated and at these doses, calcium was maintained at the desired level (above 7.5 mg/dL). At the age of 9 years, positive thyroid antibodies were detected with normal thyroid function and the diagnosis of euthyroid Hashimoto’s thyroiditis was made ( and ). On follow up, the proband underwent recurrent hospitalizations in the intensive care unit due to severe hypocalcemia which was difficult to normalize. At the age of 9.6 years, she was admitted to our hospital due to fatty acholic diarrhea, abdominal pain and a fever lasting 10 days. She had not gained weight for 12 months prior to her admission (). Laboratory evaluation revealed severe hypocalcemia. Despite high doses of intravenously (IV) administered calcium (180 mg/kg elemental calcium daily) along with oral calcium supplements of 56 mg/kg elemental calcium per day, alpha D3 (5 µg daily; 0.17 µg/kg daily) and a magnesium supplement, calcium levels remained low. It was only after initiation of calcitriol, administered IV at a dose of 0.5 µg three times a week that calcium levels were maintained. Calcitriol (1 microgram/ml) Kern Pharma, S.L.Spain. N° Reg.: 68.934. This hospitalization lasted 1 month. The episodes of hypocalcemia that required hospitalization were preceded by GI manifestations, including abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, constipation and fatty stool, and therefore an extensive GI investigation was carried out with unremarkable findings. Imaging of the upper GI tract, including a radiological GI series, demonstrated normal gastric emptying and normal bowel motility without any pathological findings for inflammatory bowel disease. Ultrasonographic scans of the abdomen were without liver or pancreatic anomalies. Upper GI endoscopic biopsies showed mild lymphocytic esophagitis, and the gastric biopsy demonstrated a picture of autoimmune atrophic gastritis with reduction in acid-secreting parietal cells, without intestinal metaplasia. There was no evidence of Helicobacter pylori and no villous atrophy of the duodenal or terminal ileal mucosa, and the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes was within the normal range. No active inflammation or granulomas were seen in the biopsies of the terminal ileum or colonic mucosa. Colonoscopy with biopsies and magnetic resonance elastography of the bowel excluded inflammatory bowel disease. Liver needle biopsy revealed no significant histopathological changes. Following these extensive GI investigations, which excluded exocrine pancreas insufficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, GI infections and autoimmune hepatitis, the diagnosis of AIE was raised, and specific CgA immunostaining of the stomach, duodenal and ileal biopsies was performed. This revealed a complete absence of EE cells in the duodenum and the small intestine with almost normal staining of the stomach, confirming the diagnosis of AIE (). After this long hospitalization, during the follow-up period, she maintained calcium serum levels within 7.5 to 10.0 mg/dL with some fluctuations, with calcium supplement of around 20 mg/kg/d and α-D3 of 2 µg daily. At the age of 13.8 years, following 4 weeks of polyuria and polydipsia, blood glucose was 450 mg/dL and HbA1c was 9.1% (normal range <5.6%). The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type 1 was made (), and insulin injections were initiated. Two months later, adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test revealed peak cortisol of 10.53 µg/dL—consistent with partial adrenal insufficiency—and oral glucocorticoid administration (10 mg/m2 per day, hydrocortisone) was initiated (). At the same age, the proband had no signs of pubertal development and growth deceleration was seen, with a decrease from the 60th to 10th centile for height (). Elevated gonadotropins confirmed a diagnosis of primary ovarian insufficiency (), and supplemental estradiol treatment was initiated. At the age of 18 years, she was admitted to our Medical Center due to coffee ground vomiting, loss of appetite and weight loss. Laboratory evaluation revealed hypercalcemia of 13.11 mg/dL that was normalized by IV 0.9% NaCl solution. Repeated intestinal biopsy revealed normal numbers of positive CgA-immunostained cells in the duodenum. Stomach biopsies demonstrated a Helicobacter pylori-positive active gastritis and an associated lymphocytic gastritis, possibly related to H. pylori as well. In a biopsy from the stomach body, no cells were present with CgA immunostaining. Sequencing of AIRE identified a previously described homozygous missense mutation (c.47C>T, p.Thr16Met), confirming the diagnosis of APECED.

Figure shows the course of her body weight, which had been around 44 kg until disease onset. Her weight loss started when she was 16 years old. She was diagnosed with an eating disorder and also presented with SMA syndrome, which seemed to be caused by weight loss due to the eating disorder because no other organic abnormality was present. The patient received conservative nutrition therapy at a hospital located in her residential area when she was 17 years old. The treatment initially improved her weight, but she ceased treatment due to dissatisfaction with the patient–doctor relationship, and her weight loss resumed.\nThe patient reported that abdominal symptoms due to SMA syndrome, such as abdominal distension and vomiting, resulted in weight loss. She desired to undergo surgery for SMA syndrome, and found on the internet a distant hospital that performed surgery for SMA syndrome. However, after undergoing laparoscopic duodenojejunostomy, her body weight did not improve during the six months after the surgery. When she was 18 years old, she arrived at our center, the University of Tokyo Hospital, with a chief complaint of weight loss. She was immediately hospitalized due to severe malnutrition.\nAt hospitalization, her height and weight were 159.1 cm and 27.5 kg, respectively (i.e., body mass index [BMI] of 10.9). She was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa binge-eating/purging type (ANBP) according to the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition []. Notably, her vomiting, which had been considered a symptom of SMA syndrome before surgery, did not improve after surgery. Therefore, her vomiting could have been a symptom of ANBP, while she initially concealed her self-induced vomiting from us and only revealed it six months after the initial visit to our hospital.\nAfter hospitalization, conservative treatment, including dietary nutrition and central venous nutrition, was performed while she was also monitored for refeeding syndrome. We further performed psychological work with the patient and her family, including psychoeducation, nutritional counseling with registered dietitians, and behavioral management based on operant conditioning [, ].

The mass was widely excised with negative margins. Microscopically, the tumor was composed of two kinds of cells: the undifferentiated small round cells and the epithelioid big cells. The cells arranged in solid sheets and trabeculae. The tumor had sheet necrosis and large thick wall blood vessels, and some areas were rich in blood vessels. The cytoplasm was scant and eosinophilic. The nuclei were small, round and uniform in shape. Nucleoli were generally small but prominent. There was brisk mitotic activity (20 mitoses per 10 high-power fields). Immunohistochemically, an extensive panel revealed expression of E-cadherin, β-catenin, INI-1, and partly expression for panCK, EMA, CD31, Bcl-2, Vimentin. The immunoreactivity for Fli-1 was weak; the expression for CD99 and S-100 was focal. The tumor was negative for TFE3, CD34, HMB45, MyoD1, Myogenin, F8, ERG. The ki67 proliferative index was approximately 60%. The targeted DNA and RNA sequencing of a panel of 1084 genes revealed a novel SS18-POU5F1 fusion. The transcript involved SS18 exon 9, and POU5F1 exon 2. The tumor mutation burden is 0.47 mutations per megabase. Immunohistochemical analysis of programmed death-ligand 1 expression using the murine 22C-3 antibody revealed a tumor proportion score 3%. The microsatellite stability analysis showed that the tumor was microsatellite stable.\nFour weeks later, the patient presented to the local hospital again with progressively worsening edema of the left lower limb. A contrast-enhanced total-body computed tomography (CT) scan (head to foot) revealed pelvic, mediastinal and bilateral subclavian lymphadenopathy (, Baseline). Ultrasound-guided biopsy of the subclavian lymphadenopathy confirmed similar pathological findings to the mass in the left thigh. On further staging, no other distant metastasis was detected.\nShe accepted 2 cycles of therapy with docetaxel, anlotinib (a multitargeted angiogenesis inhibitor) and sintilimab (a humanized programmed death receptor-1 monoclonal antibody). Concurrently, she accepted 39 Gy (3Gy×13 fractions) radiotherapy on pelvic, mediastinal and bilateral subclavian lymph node metastases. The edema of the left lower limb gradually disappear during the radiotherapy. A partial response was observed in the lesions within the radiation fields. However, unfortunately, a progressive disease was confirmed in the abdominal regions outside the radiation fields (, 1st evaluation). The patient complained of progressively worsening back pain. Sitting up and leaning forward tended to ease the pain, while lying down worsen it.\nShe was referred to our rare tumors clinic for radiotherapy on the abdominal lymph node metastases (2.5 Gy ×15 fractions). Concurrently, she accepted chemotherapy with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, ifosfamide, vinorelbine and etoposide within two months. The abdominal lesions shrank significantly during radiotherapy. The back pain resolved. However, unfortunately, severe edema of both lower limbs and inferior abdominal wall relapsed during the late stage of abdominal radiotherapy. A total-body CT scan (head to foot) showed progression of the left inguinal, pelvic, mediastinal and bilateral subclavian lymph node metastases (, 2nd evaluation).

She started menarche at the age of 14 years. Her periods were always regular at an interval of 28 days and associated with severe dysmenorrhea, with pain starting before the menstrual period and continuing throughout the period. She was not sexually active. The patient underwent abdominal computed tomography (CT) and pelvic scans for the worsening pain, which reported findings consistent with those of bicornuate uterus versus uterine fibroids. She was started on hormonal therapy, with no relief of her symptoms. She subsequently underwent transvaginal ultrasonography, which showed a fluid-filled lesion on the left side of her uterus, concerning for a unicornuate uterus with a noncommunicating horn. Magnetic resonance imaging (performed in February 2016) confirmed these findings (). No urogenital anomalies were noted using MRI. The bilateral adnexae were unremarkable.\nThe patient was referred to our clinic for worsening pelvic pain and imaging results suggestive of a Müllerian anomaly, with specific indication of a unicornuate uterus with a noncommunicating left horn. Three-dimensional transvaginal ultrasonography was performed at our clinic, showing a normally shaped endometrial cavity, endometrial thickness of 4 mm, and a separate 3 × 3-cm hypoechoic lesion in the left lateral myometrium that appeared to be distinct from the endometrial cavity.\nGiven the inconclusive findings of the abovementioned imaging studies and the persistent pelvic pain, we recommended diagnostic laparoscopy with possible resection of the cystic mass. The patient gave informed consent before the procedure. The laparoscopy revealed a 3 × 3-cm uterine mass arising from the left lateral uterine wall and extending toward the left side of the broad ligament (). Small foci of endometriotic lesions were noted in the posterior aspect of the cul-de-sac and were fulgurated. Diluted vasopressin was injected into the serosa overlying the mass; an incision in the serosa was made using monopolar scissors. The cyst was ruptured during this process, and a chocolate-brown colored fluid reminiscent of an endometrioma was noted. Suction irrigation was performed to improve visualization, and the inner cavity of the cyst was visually inspected. The appearance of the tissue lining the cyst wall was similar to that of a normal endometrium. The cyst wall was then identified and enucleated, leading to its complete resection using blunt and sharp dissection in the interphase between the myometrium and cystic adenomyoma. The cyst wall was noted to be strongly adherent. The adenomyotic cyst was entirely separated from the endometrial cavity without entering it during cyst removal. The myometrial defect was sutured in 2 layers using a 2-0 vicryl suture. Complete hemostasis was achieved, and the patient’s left fallopian tube was free of injury at the end of the treatment. The surgery was completed with minimal blood loss in approximately 2 hours.\nHistopathological examination of the cyst revealed benign smooth muscles with a decidualized endometrium, which was consistent with exogenous hormone therapy—consistent with a noncommunicating uterine horn instead of cystic endometriosis. Complete resolution of the myometrial cystic lesion and resumption of normal anatomy was noted postoperatively using transvaginal ultrasonography. Our patient is 21 years old now, relieved of her pelvic pain after the laparoscopic resection of the cystic adenomyoma. She has been prescribed continuous oral contraceptive pills for menstrual suppression.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This caused a prolapse of the periorbital tissue to the right maxillary sinus and was accompanied by displacement of the right orbital posteriorly. Examination of vertical dystopia was difficult to perform due to ptosis in the right eye. Measurement of enophthalmos based on facial CT scan revealed right enophthalmos with an 8.27 mm difference from the left orbital. The measurement of the malar projection deficit showed a difference in the malar projection of 2.86 mm. The measurement of the malar height deficit shows a difference of 4.35 mm (see ).\nThe patient was diagnosed with right inferior orbital rim fracture, right os zygoma fracture, and fracture of the right ethmoid wall.

A bedside ultrasound was performed to check for the possibility of pregnancy due to the patient’s reported symptoms, although the patient had denied the possibility of being pregnant. Unbeknownst to the patient and her family, the patient was pregnant; the ultrasound positively identified an intrauterine pregnancy and it was estimated that the patient was 22-24 weeks pregnant (Figures , ).\nThe uterine fundus was palpated approximately 2-4 cm above the umbilicus and a fetal heart rate was detected at 168 beats per minute. The patient was given a bolus of 4 g of magnesium sulfate and started on a continuous infusion. In addition, she was given 20 mg of intravenous (IV) labetalol to control her blood pressure.\nThe patient’s labs revealed the following: hemoglobin 15.7 g/dL (normal: 11.5-14.5 g/dL), white blood cell count 25,300/mm3 (normal: 4,000-10,000/mm3), platelet count 210,000/mm3 (normal: 140,000-350,000/mm3), creatinine 1.17 mg/dL (normal: 0.40-1.10 mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase 177 U/L (normal: 35-120 U/L), alanine aminotransferase 76 U/L (normal: <56 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase 78 U/L (normal: <41 UL), and proteinuria. The results of the patient’s head CT scan showed abnormal hypodense lesions in the frontal lobes, basal ganglia, parietal, and occipital lobes, concerning for infarcts or septic emboli (Figure ).\nThe patient was promptly diagnosed with eclampsia with acute kidney injury. Because the ED department where the patient presented is a small, urban ED without in-house admission capabilities, she was transferred via ambulance to the labor and delivery unit at the hospital network’s tertiary care campus.\nUpon arrival to labor and delivery, the patient’s blood pressure continued to be in a severe range. She required an additional 20, 40, and 80 mg of IV labetalol and 10 mg of IV hydralazine with minimal response. Another bedside ultrasound was performed and revealed a fetal weight of 919 g (2 pounds), an amniotic fluid index of 7.9 cm, and cephalic presentation. No obvious malformations were seen. Fetal breathing, hiccups, and movement were also found, giving the baby a biophysical profile of 6/8 due to low fluid. The patient was sent to get a magnetic resonance imaging to further image her brain, but began to contract more frequently with recurrent late decelerations, prompting an immediate C-section. The baby was born weighing 825 g (1 pound, 13.1 ounces) and estimated to be 26 weeks old.\nThe patient remained intubated and sedated after delivering her baby and was transferred to the Neuroscience Intensive Care Unit for ongoing management. She was discharged a week later with an antihypertensive regimen, Nexplanon® for contraception, and follow-up appointments to an OB/GYN. Her daughter remained under intensive care for ongoing thermoregulatory and nutritional management.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An 18-year-old female with congenital bilateral moderate SN HL who had been wearing hearing aids since the age of 4 years. She was born with a cleft palate and was highly myopic. She reported bruising easily and chronic knee pain related to recurrent patella luxation. The family history revealed that her mother needed surgical correction of cervical vertebrae, complicated by severe hemorrhage, but without further information. She had two healthy brothers. All of her mother’s pregnancies were uncomplicated. WES revealed a heterozygous pathogenic de novo variant in COL11A1 (c.4547G > T, p.(Gly1516Val)) and a likely pathogenic heterozygous variant in SMAD3 (c.3G > A (p.Met1?)) inherited from her mother.\nCOl11A1 is associated with Marshall syndrome and Stickler syndrome type II or autosomal dominant deafness type 37. Marshal syndrome is characterized by dysmorphic signs (microcretrognathia, long philtrum, robin sequence) and key clinical features, such as cleft palate, myopia and SN HL. Main complications are vitreoretinal degeneration, glaucoma and retinal detachment. Stickler syndrome is characterized by dysmorphic signs (micrognathia and Pierre Robin sequence with cleft palate), SN HL, early onset myopia, glaucoma and a risk of retinal detachment. Joint hypermobility is common and associated with an increased risk of early onset arthrosis [].\nPatients 23 and 26 were affected only by HL, while patient 24 displayed clear signs of Stickler syndrome.

She declared increased stomach pH, but no other diseases, no permanent medication, no allergies, and she smoked five cigarettes a day. The reason for extraction was repeated pain and pressure in the bone in the area of this tooth and a burnout around the tooth crown visible in the orthopantomogram (OPG) (). Before the extraction, there was no pain nor swelling. According to the surgeon, the extraction was difficult and took approximately 30 min. Peroral antibiotics were prescribed—phenoxymethylpenicillin 1.5 million international units (MIU) t.i.d.\nFive days after the extraction, severe pain in the extraction site started, irradiating to the left ear. She visited our department on the following day (six days after the extraction). She had to take peroral analgetic—nimesulid. The entry VAS was 59/100. There were food remnants in the extraction wound, and the surrounding mucosa was painful upon palpation. The suture remained in situ. Extraorally, a swelling of 2 cm × 2 cm at the mandibular angle was observed. Without local anesthesia, the wound was rinsed with 3% hydrogen peroxide, water for injection (Bieffe Medital, Grosotto, Italy), and the HA + OCT device was inserted. The patient was instructed not to smoke.\nThe first check-up was on the next day. The patient avoided smoking and declared complete relief after the treatment. However, in the morning, the pain started again. She did not have to take analgesics, and VAS was 54/100. The swelling was reduced to the size of 1 cm × 1 cm. The local treatment was repeated (the second application of the HA + OCT device).\nUntil the second check-up on the next day, VAS decreased to 2/100, and the treatment was finished.\nThe patient declared she had suffered from a similar problem in the past after the extraction of the mandibular right third molar (tooth No. 48 in FDI). Then, she was treated by repeated local procedure standardly used at our workplace, i.e., debridement and rinse of the extraction wound with 3% hydrogen peroxide, temporary intra-appointment placement of gauze soaked in a phenol-camphora spirituous solution in the extraction wound combined with the application of dry heat (infrared lamp) for 15 min, and insertion of Alveogyl. She found this new treatment method much better for its more rapid pain relief and absence of poor taste in the mouth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On inspection, the vulva was diffusely swelling, tender, red and warm (Fig. ). The patient had no other complaints apart from perineal pain and difficulty in sitting for a long time. She had previously visited another hospital with the same complaint, and on 3 occasions received incision and drainage (I&D) of the abscess. She visited a secondary hospital, where abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (APCT) showed a labia major abscess and laboratory results showed no abnormalities. She received antibiotic treatment, comprising of cephalosporin and metronidazole for 2 weeks, but her symptoms did not improve. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis was performed which revealed a 9 × 7 mm sized abscess in the right labia major (Fig. A). Under the impression of persistent vulvar abscess with positive culture results implicating Citrobacter freundii, Corynebacterium striatum, and Eschericia coli, I&D with local excision of inflamed tissues was performed under general anesthesia. The pathology results showed acute and chronic inflammation with granulation tissue formation, without indication of caseation status. Intravenous antibiotics were administered for 2 weeks and the vulvar inflammation subsided. However, inflammation and painful swelling of the contralateral labia major arose 2 weeks postoperatively.\nShe was referred to our institution, a tertiary care hospital. At the pediatric and adolescent gynecology clinic, a follow-up MRI was performed because the features of the abscess were not typical of a gynecological abscess. A deep pelvic abscess, at a higher level than Bartholin abscess, was suspected. The MRI results showed diffuse inflammation of the perineum around the posterior vaginal wall with abscess formation along both vestibular glands as well as both labia major and minor. There were also features suggestive of a rectovestibular fistula at the 12–1 ‘o’clock position (Fig. B). The patient was then clinically evaluated for Crohn’s disease because of the above MRI findings. Her laboratory tests, including inflammatory markers, were normal.\nThe patient was then referred to the pediatric gastroenterology department where she underwent further blood tests, gastroduodenoscopy, and colonoscopy to rule out other differential diagnoses, such as sarcoidosis, pyoderma gangrenosum, hiradenitis suppurativa, cellulitis, tuberculosis, and contact dermatitis. Stool calprotectin levels was elevated to > 300 µg/g, which suggested a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease. A more detailed history revealed that the patient had no history of diarrhea or hematochezia. On gastroduodenoscopy, gastric mucosa was noted to be erythematous which was suggestive of reflux esophagitis and chronic superficial gastritis. Colonoscopy revealed multiple ulcers on the mucosa of the terminal ileum and the rectum (Fig. ). Pathological evaluation of tissue specimen retrieved showed mild chronic superficial gastritis and ulceration with ill-defined noncaseating granulomatous lesions in the mucosa of the terminal ileum, which were consistent with a diagnosis of Crohn’s disease or tuberculosis. Further AFB staining and Tb-PCR performed on biopsy samples taken from the terminal ileum were negative, which ruled out tuberculosis. The rectal biopsy specimen was within normal limits. The simple endoscopic score for Crohn’s disease was 11 []. The result of the stool culture was positive for Clostridium difficile and the patient received oral metronidazole therapy.\nMRI enterography after oral contrast ingestion showed segmental and uneven wall thickening with ulcerative lesions from the distal to the terminal ileum and distal rectum with increased mucosal enhancement and diffusion restriction (Fig. ). Diffuse bilateral perineal soft tissue infiltration and increased enhancement with features suggestive of a rectovaginal (11 ‘o’clock) and a vaginoperineal (bilateral anterior) fistula were also observed. The abscess in both vestibular glands and both labia were smaller in size compared to those in the pelvic MRI performed the previous month at the gynecology department. The Pediatric Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) was 12.5, which indicated clinical response (≤ 12.5), but not inactive disease (< 10) []. The modified PCDAI score was 2.5, indicating remission (< 7.5) [].\nShe was placed on elemental diet (2000 kcal/day) four times daily for 12 weeks, azathioprine 50 mg daily, and mesalazine 1 g three times daily. Azathioprine was increased to 75 mg daily after three weeks. The elemental diet was stopped after the prescribed 12 weeks, and she was maintained on 75 mg daily of azathioprine. The vulvar lesion completely resolved and her white blood cell (WBC) count was 3470/µL during her follow-up visit after 6 weeks of treatment. Inflammatory markers were normal, and the PCDAI was 10. Oral Azathioprine was increased to 100 mg daily, with continuous WBC monitoring on follow-up.\nThe patient revisited the emergency room with vulvar pain after taking medication for Crohn’s disease for 10 weeks. On examination, there was right labia major swelling, tenderness, and pus discharge (Fig. ). She underwent a Seton procedure for rectovaginal fistula (Fig. ). While her symptoms initially improved, a recurrence required second operation. About 4 months after re-operation, her symptoms finally resolved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She had forced traction of the middle finger of the left hand from the reins of the horse.\nThe patient presented with insidious burning pain and numbness in the dorsal part of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the middle finger. No fractures were seen on radiographs; therefore, analgesic treatment was provided. After 4 months, pain remained constant and worsened with direct pressure of the proximal interphalangeal joint. She denied having fever or weight loss.\nPhysical examination revealed a diffuse mass (approximately 1 × 1 cm) on the ulnar and dorsal side of the proximal phalanx of the middle finger of the left hand. The mass was not adherent to the skin and was mobile (Figure ). The range of motion of the metacarpophalangeal joint was 90° of flexion and 0° of extension. The range of motion of the proximal interphalangeal joint was 15° of flexion and 0° of extension. The range of motion of the distal interphalangeal joint was 20° of flexion and 0° of extension. She had pain upon palpation and was positive for Tinel's sign on both the ulnar and dorsal sides of the proximal phalanx of the middle finger. Hyperthermia, skin changes, and palpable lymph nodes were not reported. Sensitivity was normal, and there were no paresthesias observed.\nRadiographs were performed, which showed a circular radiolucent image measuring 6.5 × 5 mm with thinning of the posterior cortical areas of the proximal phalanx of the middle finger (Figure ).\nUltrasound of the finger was performed, which showed vascular trajectories with ecstatic flux and venous morphology. Communication with an arterial branch was observed, which condition cortical bone irregularities (Figure ).\nAn MRI was performed, which showed a 36 × 5 × 11 mm lesion located on the dorsal side of the proximal phalanx, displacing the extensor tendons. The lesion was enhanced after gadolinium administration. There was a focal discontinuity of the cortical bone of 1 mm observed with an ectasical vascular trajectory (Figure ).\nAn incisional biopsy of the bone and soft tissue using a Jamshidi needle was performed. This illustrated a benign lesion constituted by fibrofatty tissue.\nDefinitive surgery was done 2 weeks later via complete excision of the lesion. We debrided and resected an irregular and gray tumor of 4.3 × 3 × 0.4 cm (Figure ) located on the neurovascular bundle of the ulnar side of the proximal phalanx of the middle finger (Figure ). The bone had a gray-like color on the dorsal part of the proximal phalanx and a 1-mm focal discontinuity of the cortical bone (Figure ). A 20 × 10 mm window was created to observe the medullary canal, which had a yellowish and gray-like tissue that was removed. The medullary canal was obliterated in the proximal region. Finally, the bone window and surgical wound were closed.\nHistopathological examination showed a benign lesion constituted by fibrofatty tissue that compressed the nerve fascicules with overgrowth of the remaining connective constituents, proliferation of blood vessels, myofibroblastic proliferation, and collagen deposition (Figure ). Immunohistochemistry was performed with S100, which highlighted nerve fascicles compressed by the tumor. Neither necrosis nor atypical mitosis was observed (Figure ).\nAt the latest follow-up (7 months), the patient had no pain at the surgical site. The range of motion of the finger was preserved. She had no paresthesias but continued to have numbness on the dorsal part of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the middle finger.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Her long medical history dated back to when she was just 1 year of age when she developed diffuse polyarthritis, mainly targeting both wrists and ankles. Her parents took her to the pediatric rheumatologist who diagnosed her with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and treated her mainly with prednisone and methotrexate. During the following years, and because of the lack of compliance to her medications, her arthritis was not well controlled. Therefore, she suffered from intermittent arthritis mainly affecting her wrists and hand joints which were associated with pain and swelling with spontaneous remissions. At the age of 7 years, she started having problems with her eyes; however, she had poor follow up for her condition. She presented multiple times to her local ophthalmologist with recurrent attacks of redness in her eyes and until just 1 year prior to presenting to us, when she was 16 years of age, she was diagnosed with bilateral anterior uveitis.\nThe ophthalmologist who referred the patient reported her complaint of redness and blurred vision in both eyes since 2 months and on slit lamp examination she had right eye vitreous snowballs and a hazy view along with the presence of anterior chamber inflammatory cells in both eyes but more in the right eye. She also had a history of dry eyes and was on lubricating eye drops.\nOn presentation to our clinic the patient was on oral prednisolone 5 mg/day, hydroxychloroquine 200 mg/day and omega 3 since 1 month. On slit lamp examination, keratic precipitates and inflammatory cells in the anterior chambers of eyes (+ 3 in the right eye and + 2 in the left eye) were found. Her fundus exam showed vitritis and snowballs bilaterally as well. In addition to the ocular findings, she had painless fixed flexion deformity of the proximal interphalangeal joints of the fourth and fifth fingers in both hands, known as camptodactyly (Fig. ). Moreover, the patient’s sister, aged 19 years old, had bilateral intermediate uvietis and camptodactyly of hands and feet (Fig. ). Also both eyes of their father had signs of old posterior uveitis; his left eye showed posterior synechiae 360°, a mature cataract, and old KPs, and he also had camptodactyly of both hands and feet (Fig. ).\nBased on the findings, the patient was diagnosed with recurrent bilateral intermediate uveitis and continued treatment with an increased dose of oral prednisolone (10 mg/day) as well as methorexate and she was given atropine eye drops for 1 week and steroid eye drops which was tapered gradually on each following visit. Subcutaneous Adalimumab (40 mg every 2 weeks) was added shortly after that. Moreover, she was advised to follow up with her pediatric rheumatologist for better control of her arthritis.\nMultiple lab tests were ordered and the results were as follows: her complete blood count, kidney and liver function tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C- reactive protein were within normal range. Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs) were negative and titers for rheumatoid factor (RF) were within normal range. Serologic testing for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAG) and anti-hepatitis C virus (Anti- HCV) antibodies were negative. She also did the mantoux test (PPD) which was nonreactive. A chest x-ray and a CT scan showed scattered bronchiectasis in both lungs. Pulmonary function test and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) blood levels were also ordered to rule out sarcoidosis and both of them were normal.\nIn view of the rheumatological presentation and the ophthalmological findings of intermediate uveitis, along with all of the mentioned laboratory tests being normal, it was clear that this patient may in fact not have JIA. The diagnosis was leaning more toward some sort of syndrome. Moreover, due to the fact that not only our patient had these clinical manifestations but also other members of her family, this made us think of a genetic entity. Therefore the next step was to do genetic analysis for the patient and her family via whole exome sequencing which revealed a heterozygous gain-of-function missense mutation in the NOD2 gene (p.R334Q), and therefore Blau syndrome was diagnosed (Fig. ).\nAfter that, an echocardiogram was done to rule out any cardiac involvement (pericarditis) which was free. Also an ocular optical coherence tomograpghy (OCT) was performed which only showed vitreous changes (Fig. ). She continued on the same medications with oral prednisolone (10 mg/day) and subcutaneous Adalimumab (40 mg every 2 weeks) as maintenance drugs. She responded good to the treatment and is currently doing well except for mild flare ups which were controlled with steroid eye drops.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chest examination revealed dullness to percussion, markedly absent breath sounds to auscultation and absence of respiratory vibrations to palpation over most parts of the left and right hemithoraces. The patient had no clinical signs of myasthenia gravis.\nChest CT demonstrated a giant bilateral non-cystic mass with a heterogeneous enhancement in the thoracic cavities that presses posteriorly and superiorly against the lungs. It had no calcification (). Laboratory studies were unremarkable. A transthoracic needle biopsy was performed, which revealed thymic hyperplasia. Thymoma was suspected, and surgical resection was recommended.\nA median sternotomy incision was our first choice as surgical access in order to isolate the mass from the innominate vein. The left part of the tumor was resected from outside the pleura. Bleeding occurred during this approach, and three units of blood were transfused. Due to the difficulties and the excessive blood loss with the first excision through a median sternotomy, we used the hemiclamshell approach to resect the right part of the tumor, in which we extended the median sternotomy through the 5th intercostal space to the right pleural cavity in order to make an additional anterolateral incision. This approach provided a very good exposure, through which a total resection of the right part was performed. Using this approach, we managed to perform the operation in less time, and it was easier to detect the right phrenic nerve and the right lung hilum while causing less bleeding than with the median sternotomy approach alone.\nThe resected specimen was 36 × 29 × 10 cm in size and weighed about 4500 g (), and showed well-circumscribed contours and slightly lobulated yellow cross-sections with scattered foci of ischemia.

The patient denied having any history of liver dysfunction, blood clotting disorder, allergy, or any chronic disease. Similarly, the patient's mother also denied having any similar history of bleeding in the family.\nOn 7 April 2019, a physical examination of the patient was undertaken, showing stable vital signs and no other abnormalities. Laboratory investigation of blood taken on the same day revealed a normal complete blood count, normal PT of 10.7 s (normal value of 9.8–11.2 s), prolonged aPTT of 113.2 s (normal value of 31.0–47.0 s), elevated D-dimer of 610 μg/L (normal value of <440 μg/L), normal liver function, and normal kidney function. Additional laboratory results for factor VIII and factor IX levels were <1% (normal: 40–170%) and 63.5% (normal: 51–137%), respectively. Accordingly, factor VIII inhibitors were detected at 105.00 Bethesda units (BU) (normal: not detected). The patient was diagnosed with AHA on the basis of these clinical presentations and laboratory findings.\nThe next day, the patient underwent additional laboratory tests to exclude autoimmune diseases. These tests showed an ANA score of 1/320 with homogeneous patterns, while tests of anti-dsDNA, C3, and C4 were within normal limits. These results showed that autoimmune diseases were unlikely to be a precipitating factor of AHA.\nThe patient was treated with both tranexamic acid (3 × 1000 mg) and injection of human factor VIII (2000 IU) for 2 days (8-9 April 2019); however, there was no significant clinical improvement. On 9 April 2019, it was decided to treat the patient with methylprednisolone (3 × 16 mg; equivalent to a prednisone dose of 1 mg/kg/day for 1 month). After 1 month of follow-up, her clinical presentation and laboratory parameters showed improvements. The corticosteroid treatment was then continued. In the second month, the methylprednisolone dose was reduced to 2 × 16 mg. Subsequently, in the third month, it was tapered to 24 mg (16–0–8 mg). In the fourth month of treatment, bruising no longer occurred. The methylprednisolone therapy was nevertheless continued with a dose of 2 × 8 mg, which was reduced by 4 mg weekly until the patient achieved steroid-free status. No relapse in terms of bruises or bleeding was observed after 6 months without steroid.

She was diagnosed with atypical CHS 3 years prior by LYST RNA analysis and based on her clinical course. Because of repeated infections, she was scheduled to undergo haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in our paediatrics department after the completion of treatment for her limb pain, which is one of the neurological symptoms of CHS. At her first visit, the general findings included hyperpigmentation on the facial skin, which is often seen in Asian CHS. Her intraoral examination revealed extensive gingival swelling and redness and gingival retraction in the right lower central incisor (). The gingival pocket depth was 5–6 mm, the degree of movement was grade 1, and the O'Leary plaque control record (PCR) value was 80% ().\nWe initiated professional oral care and self-administered oral care education 7 weeks before transplantation (). Her intelligence quotient was 75, and she feared using the ultrasonic scaler, so we made an effort to eliminate her fear. We performed professional mechanical tooth cleaning and cleaned the periodontal pockets. The O'Leary PCR value was very high on her first visit. However, it decreased following the educational sessions, and it was 58% at the final session before bone marrow transplantation. Approximately 2 weeks before transplantation, she entered the cleaning room. Etoposide, busulfan, and cyclophosphamide were administered, and grade 1 mucositis was observed as a side effect on the day before transplantation. The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 was used to evaluate mucositis. From the day after transplantation, redness was observed on her oral mucosa as a side effect of methotrexate, and she experienced pain that rendered brushing impossible (). A gargle containing lidocaine (Xylocaine®) was effective. The use of Episil® oral liquid was also attempted, but she used it only once for irritation. Six days after transplantation, she developed grade 3 mucositis and underwent nutritional management via infusion. From 2 weeks after transplantation, her oral condition improved slightly (). At 20 days after transplantation, the mucositis gradually improved, and brushing became possible. At 27 days after transplantation, the mucositis disappeared. The gingival swelling became mild, redness improved, and no gingival bleeding was detected during brushing (). She was discharged 84 days after transplantation. Although there was no change in the degree of tooth movement, the gingival pocket depth and gingival swelling in the lower anterior region improved, and the O'Leary PCR value was 24.1%, which was lower than that before transplantation ().",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

jOnathaN jENNiNgs,18,F,AB+,Diabetes,03-12-2022,Kaylee Miller,Garcia Sons and,Aetna,43979.26332,491,Urgent,19-12-2022,Aspirin,Normal,"An 18-year-old female undergoing treatment for classic Hodgkin's lymphoma visited the PET/CT facility of Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi, Pakistan, for a follow-up 18F-FDG PET/CT scan. Her diagnosis was established based on the histopathology of a right cervical node. Her baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT scan demonstrated enlarged hypermetabolic nodes in the right cervical region, which were treated with six cycles of chemotherapy (adriamycin, bleomycin sulfate, vinblastine sulfate, and dacarbazine) followed by four fractions of radiotherapy to the cervical region. At the time of her follow-up 18F-FDG PET/CT scan, a dose of 165.76 MBq of F-18 FDG was administered through the right hand. The scan was performed after a delay of 60 minutes. Initially, molecular imaging was performed from the head to mid-thighs. A low dose plain CT scan was then obtained over the same region for anatomic correlation and attenuation correction.\nThe baseline and interim 18F-FDG PET/CT scans were compared to the current examination in detail on the Mirada workstation (Mirada Medical, Oxford, UK). The previously seen 18F-FDG avid cervical nodes had resolved entirely in the current scan. There was no evidence of any newly developed 18F-FDG avid node in the neck, chest, or abdomen. There was no evidence of pleuropulmonary, hepatic, adrenal, splenic, or skeletal lymphomatous involvement. A few areas of benign/nonspecific uptake were noted in the 18F-FDG PET/CT scan. In the head and neck region, there was newly developed linearly orientated 18F-FDG uptake in the floor of the mouth, projecting over the left mylohyoid muscle, without anatomical correlate suggesting physiologic uptake (Figure ). In the mediastinum, there was diffuse 18F-FDG uptake in the moderately enlarged thymus, which considering the history of chemotherapy, was regarded as post-chemotherapy rebound hyperplasia (Figure ). Mild 18F-FDG avid tonsillar enlargement was also noted.\nAlarmingly, there was a new focus of 18F-FDG uptake (maximum standardized uptake value [SUVmax] 5.5) in the right iliac region, which imitated the shape of a finger-like structure connected to the medial wall of the cecum. On correlative CT images, the appendix appeared dilated with diffuse wall thickening of up to 6.0 mm (Figures , ). There was no evidence of adjacent fat stranding. Unexpected and incidental foci of uptake in oncologic 18F-FDG PET/CT are relatively common with diagnostic considerations, including unusual sites of metastases, a second synchronous neoplasm, post-surgical changes, and infection and inflammation. In our patient, the top differentials for appendicular 18F-FDG uptake included either submucosal infiltration of the appendix by lymphomatous cells or acute appendicitis. Despite the absence of 18F-FDG uptake everywhere in the body, the appendicular uptake was alarming since it indicated progressive disease rather than a complete metabolic response. This shift in the magnitude of the metabolic response to treatment had significant implications for subsequent management and treatment planning. Hence, the 18F-FDG avidity in the right lower quadrant warranted careful interpretation to establish the metabolic response to chemotherapy and avoid misdiagnosis of the lymphomatous spread of disease.\nThe patient was requested to revisit the hospital for further evaluation. Before the 18-F FDG PET/CT scan, our patient did not mention any active complaints at the time of clinical evaluation. On directed questioning, she mentioned intermittent right lower quadrant pain for the past few days, relieved by painkillers. She also reported anorexia for the past two days. An abdominal ultrasound was performed the same day, which demonstrated an inflamed appendix in the right iliac region, giving the shape of a blind-ended tubular structure with mild periappendiceal fluid. There was no evidence of hyperechoic focus within the lumen casting posterior acoustic shadowing to suggest the presence of an appendicolith (Figure ). Her laboratory tests revealed leucocytosis of 12700/μl with 80% neutrophils, serum hemoglobin 12.1 g/dl, platelets 350,000/mcL, and C-reactive protein 45.0 mg/dl. The consecutive serum lactose dehydrogenase levels during the past three months were 272.0 U/L, 251.0 U/L, and 242.0 U/L. On physical examination, there was rebound tenderness in the right iliac region on deep palpation. According to the Alvarado score, it was graded 7 points suggesting probable/likely appendicitis. After collective evaluation of the clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings (ultrasound), the appendicular 18F-FDG uptake was deemed secondary to uncomplicated acute appendicitis rather than lymphomatous involvement of the appendix. Our patient refused surgical intervention as she did not have severe abdominal pain. She was hemodynamically stable and was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (ceftriaxone 2 grams once a day for six days). The follow-up complete blood counts were: white blood cells 6800/μl with 55% neutrophils, hemoglobin 11.5 g/dl, platelets 315,000/mcL, and C-reactive protein 8.0 mg/dl. The follow-up ultrasound examination was negative.

There was no history of fever, hematemesis, or malena. She did not have similar episodes in the past. On examination, she was vitally stable. She had diffuse tenderness and distension on per abdominal examination. Rest of abdominal examination was unremarkable. Per rectal examination was normal.\nOn investigating further, plain X-ray of the abdomen showed no abnormalities. Ultrasonography of abdomen and pelvis revealed: ileocolic intussusception in the right iliac fossa with ileum extending into ascending colon up to right half of transverse colon; ileoileal intussusception in left iliac fossa for a length of 8 cm; multiple enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes of average size 10 mm; and mild ascites. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the whole abdomen confirmed the diagnosis demonstrating three regions of intussusceptions, namely, jejunojejunal, jejunoileal, and colocolic intussusceptions and irregular wall thickening involving the sigmoid colon (\n).\nAfter obtaining consent, patient was taken up for emergency exploratory laparotomy. All three intussusceptions were reduced without any complications. Bowel wall was mildly edematous without any obvious signs of ischemia/necrosis. Multiple polyps in the jejunum, ileum, and sigmoid colon were found to be lead points (\n). Jejunotomy and sigmoidotomy were done to remove the respective polyps. The ileal polyp was hemorrhagic in appearance, which was suspicious of malignancy. Since frozen section was not available at the time of surgery, an intraoperative decision was made to proceed with ileal resection with 5 cm margin proximal and distal to polyp. The specimens were sent for histopathological examination. Rest of the abdomen was examined and found to be normal. The patient tolerated the surgery well. She made an uneventful recovery. Patient was discharged on postoperative day 5.\nHistopathological report revealed: resected ileal segment—moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (grade II) arising on the background of adenomatous polyp; jejunal polyp—adenomatous polyp with low-grade dysplasia; sigmoid polyp—adenomatous polyp with low-grade dysplasia; and appendix—chronic appendicitis (no granulomas/malignancy) (\n).\nOn follow-up, patient was started on CAPEOX regimen (tablet capecitabine 500 mg 2–0–2 × 14 days injection oxaliplatin 180 mg), 21-day cycles for 6 cycles.

As a result, she had been given a medical exemption for vaccinations. She experienced episodes following other unpleasant stimuli including ear piercings and accidental cuts.\nDuring an episode, the patient would become pale and lose consciousness, followed by generalized shaking movements and urinary incontinence. These episodes started at age 12 and were relatively infrequent. Her mother estimated five prior episodes. She had no prior EEGs and had never tried any medications for the episodes, but she was now more interested in treatment as she was leaving for college. Her only medication was sertraline for anxiety.\nThe patient was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for further evaluation. MRI of the brain on admission was unremarkable and non-lesional for seizures. On the first day, after being pricked for an IV placement, she had a witnessed episode. Baseline monitoring is seen in Figure . Ten seconds after the attempted IV, her heart rate slowed (Figure ). Approximately 30 seconds after the IV, she had 30 seconds of asystole (Figures , ). She became pale and diaphoretic, followed by tonic posturing and loss of consciousness. Ninety seconds after the prick, she displayed clonic jerking lasting 10 seconds (Figure ), along with urinary incontinence.\nOn the second day of admission, there was a second attempt at IV placement, with the patient connected to a 12-lead EKG. She had a second characteristic episode. EEG in both cases showed sudden onset bilateral delta slowing. Baseline EEG was otherwise normal. The patient was seen by cardiology and electrophysiology, and she was diagnosed with vagally mediated sinus arrest. A pacemaker was not recommended because the episodes were infrequent. The patient had no known family history of seizures or similar episodes, and interestingly her father did have a pacemaker for AV block.\nA few days later, a trial was done with the patient receiving 5 mg intranasal midazolam one minute prior to an IV stick. She was able to remain alert and asymptomatic after this stick, with no syncope or seizure episode occurring.

The onset of the disease was two weeks earlier with fever and sore throat. She had consulted the general practitioner who established the diagnosis of exudative tonsillitis and recommended treatment with 625 mg amoxicillin/clavulanate three times per day and 200 mg ibuprofen two times per day. The patient followed the treatment for 12 days, but the condition worsened, the fever gradually went up and a bulge appeared on the left side of the neck.\nHer past medical history was inconspicuous; the patient denied consumption of tobacco, alcohol, recreational drugs or oral birth control drugs. She had received all the mandatory immunization (according to the Romanian national program).\nThere was no contact with other sick persons with similar symptoms.\nWhen she was admitted to the hospital, her general condition was consistent with moderate sepsis; she had fever (38.9 °C), elevated pulse rate (137 bpm), normal blood pressure (116/74 mm Hg) and normal oxygen saturation (97%). A significant lymph nodes enlargement (about 6 cm in diameter) was noted on the left side of the neck, in front and behind the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and left supraclavicular adenopathy; there was limited movement of the enlarged lymph nodes and they were hard on palpation. Both tonsils showed white exudate on their surface. There was no abnormal lung or heart sounds, no liver or spleen enlargement and no neurological abnormalities. The urine output was normal.\nThe initial laboratory tests are shown in .\nThe chest X-ray showed consolidation on the lower right lobe. An ultrasound of the left side of the neck highlighted the lymph nodes enlargement, intense vascularization and a deep edema. A computed tomography (CT) of the neck (see and ) and the upper thorax showed segmental partial thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein.

Two months earlier, she presented with pain in the large joints of all extremities, with no evident trigger for its development, and pruritic and painless rash formation on the skin of the dorsum of the shoulders (Fig. ) and both wrists and both sides of the thighs, which worsened with increasing symptoms. Febrile and night sweats were observed on the sixth day upon admission. The patient was admitted to the hospital for blood analysis, and the blood test results were as follows: ferritin, 466.4 ng/ml; C-reactive protein (CRP) level, 82.7 mg/l; interleukin-6 level, 85.12 pg/ml; white blood cell count, 15.55 × 109/L; and neutrophils, 89.3%. The patient’s antinuclear antibody was positive (titer 1:100), but her rheumatoid factor,anti double stranded DNA antibody, Anti smooth muscle antibody,anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibodies and anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibodies were negative. Since symptom onset, the patient lost 5 kg of body weight. Examination revealed the presence of bilateral posterior cervical lymph nodes, left supraclavicular lymph nodes, and left posterior axillary lymph nodes without tenderness. According to the new classification of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) published by the European alliance against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the American Society of Rheumatology (ACR) in 2019 [], clinicians have excluded the diagnosis of SLE. Following the clinical suspicion of lymphoma, left neck lymph node resection was performed for pathological examination.\nOne lymph node was resected, measuring approximately 2.5 × 2 × 1.2 cm, with its cut surface gray white and gray red in color and medium in texture.\nThe lymph node structure was partially preserved (Fig. a),the subcapsular and medullary sinuses were slightly dilated, and the sinus comprised a larger amount of histiocytes (Fig. b). The cortical areas were atrophic and smaller (Fig. c), and a few lymphoid follicles of various sizes were observed (Fig. d). Some of the follicular germinal centers were atrophic and smaller (Fig. e), some follicles germinal centers were hyperplastic and enlarged with the phenomenon of “starry sky”.The paracortical areas of the lymph nodes were diffusely hyperplastic and enlarged,mainly comprised abundant histiocytes, immunoblasts and medium-sized T lymphocytes with slightly irregular nuclei,against a background scattered with a higher amount of plasma cells and a few infiltrating eosinophils (Fig. f). In some areas, histiocytic hyperplasia was patchy,and a few proliferating histiocytes had distorted and elongated nuclei with irregular morphology (Fig. a). In some areas, immunoblasts proliferated in a “mottled” manner, with a small amount of apoptotic nuclear debris and phagocytosis of nuclear debris by histiocytes. Medium-sized T lymphocytes were actively proliferative,karyorrhexis was easily observed, and the proliferation of high endothelial venules in the paracortical area showed a complex branching pattern (Fig. b).\nProliferating histiocytes expressed CD68 and CD163, and some expressed S-100 (Fig. c) and myeloperoxidase. The proliferating immunoblasts were strongly and weakly heterogeneously positive for CD30 and CD20,and negative for CD15.The proliferating medium-sized T lymphocytes in the paracortical areas expressed CD3, CD5, CD4, and CD8, with a slight predominance of CD8-positive cells (Fig. d), and some T cells expressed granzyme B and T-cell intracellular antigen 1. The proliferation index of Ki-67 in the hot spots of paracortical areas was about 40%, and plasma cells expressed CD138 but not immunoglobulin 4(IgG4). Lymphoid follicles expressed CD20, CD10, and BCL-6,and did not express BCL-2,the proliferation index of Ki-67 was approximately 80%. CD123, CD56, TdT, ALK, and CK antibodies were not detected.\nThe final diagnosis was adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD), combined with clinical manifestations, laboratory examination and lymph node pathological biopsy. The patient received a comprehensive medical treatment after the operation, including symptomatic treatment, oral prednisone acetate tablets and methotrexate.

She was instructed nil per os (NPO) and serum therapy and was also given pantoprazole and pethidine for her pain management.\nThe patient was awake and hemodynamically stable and had a low-grade fever (37.6 Celsius axillary). There was no history of alcohol abuse, diabetes, biliary or peptic ulcer disease or trauma and the family history was unremarkable. She was taking no medications. Physical examination revealed a well-developed female in moderate distress. No sinus tenderness or nasal polyposis was noted. There was no submandibular and axillary lymphadenopathy. The lungs were clear. There was no digital clubbing. The cardiac examination was unremarkable. The abdominal examination revealed moderate epigastric tenderness.\nSerum biochemical analysis showed that her serum amylase was 1288 IU/L (normal up to 130 IU/L) and serum lipase was 1541 IU/L (normal up to 160 IU/L). So she was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. The laboratory tests for assessing the etiology of acute pancreatitis including serum calcium, serum lipids, liver function tests, bilirubin and glucose, immunology tests, β-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (beta HCG), sweat test (for excluding cystic fibrosis as a rare cause of presentation), and complete blood count were obtained and were all normal. The electrolytes and blood cultures were also normal. The serum IgG4 level was obtained to assess autoimmune chronic pancreatitis (AIP), which was 1378 mg/L (normal 110-1570 mg/L) (). Abdominal and pelvic spiral CT scan () revealed the edematous pancreas and enhancing loculi fluid accumulation around pancreas along with the small amount of ascites fluid that all suggest acute pancreatitis.\nWe also obtained abdominal sonography that revealed no gallbladder stone but showed an edematous pancreas with anterior-posterior (AP) diameter of 4 cm which is suggestive of pancreatitis. Magnetic resonance cholangio pancreatography (MRCP) was performed at 1.5 Tesla scanner using the body coil that revealed the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts that showed normal caliber (). The gallbladder was unremarkable.\nDue to the presentation of fever and COVID-19 pandemic and her potential society exposure, the CRP (C-reactive protein) level was checked which was 3+. Moreover, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in specimens taken from combined NPSs and throat swabs that were positive for SARS-CoV-2.

During admission, the patient demonstrated worsening encephalopathy, quadriplegia, aphasia, seizures, and right eye blindness. Labs showed high-titer positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) (1:1280), anti-Smith antibody (Anti-Sm Ab) (114 AAU/mL), anti-double-stranded DNA antibody (anti-ds DNA Ab) (1:320), and low levels of C3 and C4 complement, thus confirming the diagnosis of SLE. However, labs were negative for LAC, aCL, and aβ2GPI.\nImaging revealed several central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhages present in the frontal lobes, temporal lobes, basal ganglia, and brainstem. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) showed intraparenchymal hemorrhage, partial thrombosis of the left transverse sinus, and attenuated vessels with a beaded appearance in the Circle of Willis (Figure ); these findings were concerning for vasculitis. Findings on the fundoscopic exam suggested central retinal artery occlusion, central retinal vein occlusion, and bilateral retinal vasculitis.\nThe patient was treated with pulse steroids, cyclophosphamide, IVIG, and rituximab for suspected SLE-induced CNS vasculitis. Upon clinical improvement after three weeks, she was then transferred to a rehab institute, where she became tachycardic and hypoxic during one session of physical therapy. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, CT-PE, at this time showed bilateral pulmonary emboli involving the main pulmonary, segmental, and subsegmental arteries. Venous duplex ultrasound revealed a deep vein thrombosis in the right common femoral vein and superficial venous thrombi in the left cephalic and basilic veins.\nAfter transfer to the ICU, the patient experienced a new onset of tachycardia and tachypnea. Physical exam showed anisocoria in which the right pupil was larger than the left, sluggish reaction to light of the right pupil, the chronic hyperpigmented discoid appearance of bilateral auricles, hair thinning, and weakened strength in the bilateral upper and lower extremities (1/5). Lab findings showed leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Coagulation studies including Protein C and S and anti-thrombin deficiency and COVID-19 test were unremarkable. Anti Jo-1, anti-Scl 70, anti-SSA, anti-SSB, and anti-RNP antibodies were negative.\nDue to concern for CAPS, the patient was given intravenous (IV) pulse steroids (methylprednisolone 1g daily for three days), followed by 1 mg/kg oral steroids, and initiated on plasmapheresis. Anticoagulation was held due to the recent intracranial hemorrhage. Despite this, the patient had a further decline in her C3 and C4 complement levels. Given the severe systemic burden of clots, negative lab values for aPL, and now with the continued decline in C3 and C4 complement despite multiple immunomodulatory agents, seronegative CAPS was highly suspected as the diagnosis.\nTherefore, possible eculizumab administration was discussed and plans were made to obtain it. During this process, the patient was continued on her immunosuppression regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide infusion (1g every four weeks), IV methylprednisolone (1mg/kg daily), and plasmapheresis (five sessions total). This regimen resulted in gradual clinical improvement and an increase in C3 and C4 levels. CT of the thorax revealed a reduced pulmonary embolism burden. She was continued on high-dose steroids, cyclophosphamide for a total of six doses, and plasmapheresis for five sessions. Due to her improving clinical stability, eculizumab and systemic anticoagulation were held off, and the patient was sent to rehabilitation and discharged.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Soon after, she developed bilateral foot and ankle pain, first on the right and subsequently on the left, with the pain progressing over the course of 2 months to the point where she could no longer bear weight.\nShe reported no history of recent upper respiratory infection, GI infection, or vaccination. She had no history of hematologic or visceral malignancy. She was previously healthy and took no prescribed medications. She reported no history of smoking, alcohol or drug use. Her urine pregnancy test was negative.\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital due to worsening lower extremity pain, fevers (greater than 39°C), and tachycardia. Bilateral foot and ankle tenderness, warmth, and swelling were noted with several spontaneously draining fluid collections (, ). An erythematous plaque was also seen in the right forearm (). Leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers were noted, including a WBC count of 19.4 K/uL with 81% neutrophils, CRP of 287 mg/L and ESR of 102 mm/hr. CT demonstrated splenic fluid collections and subsequent chest radiograph demonstrated a left pleural effusion (, ). Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography were negative for any cardiac vegetations. Blood, pleural fluid, and splenic fluid cultures were negative, including aerobic, anaerobic, fungal, and AFB cultures. QuantiFERON-TB Gold, Parvovirus, Bartonella and Brucella antibody titers were also negative. Due to initial suspicion for infection, broad-spectrum antibiotics were started (vancomycin and piperacillin / tazobactam), but these were discontinued after the infectious workup was negative. p-ANCA was positive, which can be seen in several auto-immune conditions. Rheumatologic workup was otherwise negative, including ANA, RF, and complement levels.\nMRI of the bilateral ankles and/or feet revealed multiple soft tissue fluid collections, focal fluid signal intensity within the left calcaneus with surrounding edema-like marrow signal intensity, and abnormal marrow signal in the right hallux distal phalanx tuft concerning for infection (, ). However, the clinical picture and negative infectious workup prompted consideration of an inflammatory and/or autoimmune process. Punch biopsy of the right foot skin eruption revealed heavy dermal inflammation with abundant neutrophils, nuclear debris (leukocytoclasis), no vasculitic changes (fibrin deposition, necrosis or thrombosis of vessels), and no organisms, all of which suggested SS ().\nThe patient was started on systemic corticosteroids, initially IV prednisolone (50 mg daily for 3 days) and subsequently oral prednisone (40 mg daily). Her fever subsided and leukocytosis and CRP improved with steroids. The fluid collections in her feet markedly improved on clinical exam. Since SS may be associated with inflammatory bowel disease and since her symptoms started with hematochezia, she underwent a colonoscopy which revealed erythematous inflammation in the cecum. Biopsies of this area showed cryptitis, crypt abscess, and active and chronic colitis suggestive of Crohn's disease (). She underwent physical therapy, regained mobility, and was discharged home 3 weeks after admission. Subsequent MRI confirmed marked improvement in her left foot fluid collections (Fig. 8).\nA final diagnosis of hemorrhagic bullae secondary to SS in the setting of Crohn's colitis was made. The prednisone was ultimately tapered and discontinued, and the patient's symptoms continue to improve on scheduled adalimumab.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On admission at 23/0 WG, she complained about massive loss of amniotic fluid. The PPROM was additionally confirmed by positive test of PAMG-1, (AmniSure®, Qiagen Company, France) and anhydramnion. The estimated fetal weight was 336 g. The patient received a single course of betamethasone (12 mg daily for two days; Celestan®, Essex Pharma, Munich, Germany) for prophylaxis of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Ampicillin (1000 mg; intravenous) three times daily (Ratiopharm GmbH, Ulm, Germany) and one application of azithromycin (500 mg; per os) (Hexal AG, Holzkirchen, Germany) were used according to the German guidelines []. A cervical bacterial swab was performed weekly (Table ), C-reactive protein (CRP), leucocytes and Interleukin-6 were monitored and controlled daily (Fig. ).\nAppropriate counseling was provided including risks and benefits of preterm birth for the fetus and mother, conservative management versus continuous amniotic infusion via a perinatal catheter system with Amnion Flush Solution (2400 ml daily) combined with intrauterine administration of antibiotics (clindamycin 600 mg, Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany) [, , ]. The implantation of a perinatal ‘anker’ catheter was performed at the 23/2 WG (Fig. , day 0) with the permission of the Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg’s ethics committee, and written informed patient consent [, ].\nAt 23/6 WG, a cervical bacterial swab culture showed colonization by multi-resistant 3-MRGN E. coli sensitive to meropenem. This antibiotic is listed as Category B in pregnancy []. We could not find any information about the intraamniotic use of meropenem and its local effect on the fetus and amniotic membrane. Only a little information was available in relation to meropenem’s effect on neonates [, ].However, a low trans-placental passage of meropenem is known []. Appropriate counseling was provided with neonatology and infectiology teams including the risks and benefits for fetus and mother. The possibility of intraamniotic meropenem application was discussed with the family before getting written informed consent.\nMeropenem (Eberth Pharma, Germany) was administered for ten days at 500 mg/day using the perinatal catheter system into the amniotic cavity and 1000 mg three times/day intravenously (Table ).\nSensitive to the antibiogram, ciprofloxacin (Ciprobay®, Bayer Vital, Germany) was administered for eight days at 400 mg/day through the into the amniotic cavity and 500 mg twice a day per os. The therapy with meropenem was restarted because of a positive multi-resistance 3-MRGN E. coli culture.\nThe patient gave birth to a male infant via cesarean section at 28/3rd WG (birth weight 1480 g, Apgar score of 7/7/7 at 1/5/10 min, umbilical venous pH 7.49, BE-3) because of increased inflammation parameter Interleukin-6 and CRP without maternal fever. The neonate was transferred to neonatal intensive care unit for further diagnostic and therapeutic management. The newborn required a less invasive surfactant application (Alfeofact®, Lyomark Pharma) followed by non-invasive ventilator support for five days. At admission, Interleukin-6 and CRP values were within normal range. The blood culture as well as throat and umbilical swabs were sterile. The meropenem treatment of the newborn was discontinued at the third day because no clinical signs of neonatal infection were displayed during the period of hospitalization. The neonate was discharged weighing of 3606 g in good condition. The histological examination of amniotic membranes and placenta (weight 405 g, size 14 cm × 13 cm × 3 cm), showed no signs of chorioamnionitis.

She believed she was approximately two months pregnant but was unsure about her last menstrual period. She had not followed up with an obstetrician for her pregnancy, per chart review. The patient was given an informal diagnosis of hyperemesis gravidarum based on one previous ED visit when she had presented with emesis and was started on metoclopramide. She had been having six to eight episodes of emesis daily but denied emesis on the day of presentation. She reported light spotting but denied any tissue passage. She stated she had gone through one pad a day in the prior three days. Review of symptoms was positive for fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and vaginal bleeding. The patient had no chronic medical conditions or pertinent social or family history. She was taking metoclopramide 10 milligrams (mg) as needed for nausea and prenatal vitamins daily.\nUpon arrival to the ED, the patient had a temperature of 97.9° Fahrenheit, heart rate of 160 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96% on room air, and blood pressure of 95/57 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). On exam, she was tachycardic, had generalized abdominal tenderness, and appeared agitated with a flattened affect. She would answer questions appropriately but tersely with one word.

Signs and symptoms were splenomegaly, severe anemia, jaundice, reticulocytosis, fatigue, and abdominal discomfort. Total splenectomy (TS) was undertaken through a laparotomy incision. Before elective splenectomy, an antibiotic (latamoxef 250 mg, i.v., b.i.d., 1 week) was used prophylactically to reduce the risk of potentially fatal overwhelming post-splenectomy sepsis (OPSS) from encapsulated bacteria. After TS, the patient was in good health. No evidence of infection with pneumococci, H. influenzae, N. meningitides, or other bacteria was found. The patient was not screened for M. tuberculosis infection until the present time. The patient had received the bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine as a child in China, and did not have a history of contact with a person with active tuberculosis.\nInitially, the patient experienced fever, fatigue, and weight loss for 5 months before presentation, with subsequent development of enlargement of cervical lymph nodes for 1 week. Color ultrasound images showed enlargement of multiple lymph nodes (1.51 cm × 0.52 cm in zone II of the neck on the right side; 2.75 cm × 1.66 cm in zone IV of the neck on the right side; 1.92 cm × 0.71 cm in zone II of the neck on the left side; 1.11 cm × 1.00 cm in the right supraclavicular fossa; 1.00 cm × 0.66 cm in the left supraclavicular fossa). The patient was screened for suspected hematological diseases (e.g., malignant lymphoma) through puncture biopsy of lymph nodes by the Hematology Department of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University (a general hospital in Shenyang). In addition, the histological features of the enlarged right cervical lymph node revealed granulomatous lesions with necrosis. Further examination of the lungs using computed tomography (CT) disclosed that the right hilar lymph node was enlarged and adjacent bronchi were compressed and narrowed, along with enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum and left axillary region. These findings pointed towards a diagnosis of disseminated tuberculous lymphadenitis.\nIn January 2021, the patient was admitted to the Department of Pediatric Tuberculosis within Shenyang Chest Hospital in Shenyang. Upon admission, the patient presented with fever, fatigue, respiratory rate of 19 breaths/min, and heart rate of 90 beats/min. Oxygen saturation in room air was normal. Blood pressure was 105/76 mmHg. Enlarged lymph nodes were found in the bilateral cervical regions and left axilla during physical examination. Lymph nodes in the right cervical region and left axilla were fluctuant, whereas those in the left cervical region were hard. All detected lymph nodes were solitary. Significant abnormal findings were not observed in other examinations.\nContrast-enhanced CT of the neck revealed a round, soft-tissue shadow (25.1 mm × 14.2 mm) in the right supraclavicular area with a CT value of 46 HU. Contrast-enhanced imaging revealed annular enhancement with a higher CT value of 70 HU. The right internal jugular vein was compressed and flat.\nMultiple enlarged lymph nodes (the largest sized 27.1 mm × 23.3 mm) were observed in the mediastinal space, thoracic entrance, and left axilla. Inhomogeneous annular enhancement was observed with a CT value of 36 HU. A lymph node of size 28.2 mm × 26.5 mm was detected in the right hilum with a CT value of 40 HU. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed inhomogeneous annular enhancement with a higher CT value of 65 HU (Fig. A–D). Color ultrasound images showed multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the bilateral neck, left axilla, and bilateral groin. The number, distribution, diameter, and manifestation of enlarged lymph nodes are presented in Table .\nThe X.DOT-TB (TB Healthcare, Foshan, China) tuberculosis test result was positive (Table ). The Xpert MTB/RIF test (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) result of the sputum specimen was negative. An induced sputum acid-fast bacillus smear was examined thrice, and was negative on each occasion. MGIT 960 culture of the sputum specimen (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) was negative, along with the remainder of an extensive workup of infection detection. Subsequently, the patient was started on a four-drug regimen incorporating rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for treatment of clinically diagnosed active tuberculous lymphadenitis. Results of laboratory examinations upon hospital admission are shown in Table .\nDuring the first 2 weeks of tuberculosis treatment, the patient complained of persistent pain in the left axillary lymph node. An enlarged lymph node was detected, and the left axillary lymph node was surgically excised (Fig. A). Lymphoid tissue was of dimension 3.0 cm × 2.0 cm × 1.7 cm. Postoperative pathology revealed granulomatous inflammation and caseous necrosis surrounded by epithelial-like and multinucleated giant cells (Fig. B, C). Results from the Xpert MTB/RIF assay of lymphoid-tissue specimens were positive. Lymphoid tissue was sensitive to rifampicin, which further confirmed the diagnosis of extensively disseminated M. tuberculosis into the lymph nodes. After receiving standard treatment for tuberculosis for 2 months, her clinical symptoms improved, and fever, fatigue, and emaciation disappeared. Enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, axilla, and groin were reduced. The patient continues to receive tuberculosis treatment.

On arrival, her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, pulse rate 91/min, respiratory rate 18/min, and body temperature 36.5 °C. Initial laboratory exams were as follows: hematocrit—33%, hemoglobin—10.0 g/dL, and lactate–−1.5, which were interpreted as characteristic of moderate acute bleeding (hemorrhagic shock class 2). After the initial evaluation in the ED, she was noted to have a cold, pale, pulseless left foot with absent popliteal and ankle pulses. She had a complete degloving of the entire posterior part of the left leg, with exposure of the gastrocnemius muscle from the popliteal region to the distal third of this leg. No other skeletal or non-skeletal injuries were noted on the initial examination. Initial radiographs of the left leg and knee revealed a transverse fracture of the distal tibia and fibula, suggesting a rolling mechanism of the bus wheel as it passed over her leg. She was diagnosed as having a traumatic transection of the popliteal artery associated with an open distal tibia shaft and fibula fracture. A tourniquet was applied to her left thigh to restrict blood flow to the injured limb, thus potentially preventing life-threatening blood loss, and she was immediately taken to the Operating Theatre (OT), where she underwent general anesthesia with an orotracheal tube. The decision was taken as a protective ventilation strategy. In the OT, she had a secondary examination of the left leg, and the injuries were confirmed by direct inspection (). Due to the short ischemia time (less than 1 h), the tourniquet was kept in place, and the initial debridement was carried out with the patient in the supine position. Then, the distal tibia and fibula fracture was reduced, and a half-pin spanning external fixator was applied on the anterior aspect of the left lower limb, with the knee in slight flexion (approximately 10°) and the ankle in neutral position. The initial surgical management took no longer than 30 min. The patient was re-positioned in the prone position for the second part of the procedure. Vascular surgeons performed a thorough exploration of the popliteal vessels, tibial nerve, and their branches, noting a complete transection in the middle part of the popliteal artery, which was repaired by direct vessel reconstruction with an end-to-end repair. Due to the slight flexion of the knee, a tension-free anastomosis was possible, with no need for interposition graft. The open wound was thoroughly irrigated, and the skin flaps were loosely approximated and sutured to the gastrocnemius muscle (). A deep posterior compartment fasciotomy was performed, but no further decompression was required for the anterior and lateral compartments of the leg. A bulky Jones dressing was applied, as the negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) was not available in the hospital. There was no need for inotropes or vasopressors during surgery. At the end of the procedure, her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 115/80 mmHg, pulse rate 69/min, respiratory rate 14/min, and body temperature 36.5 °C. The patient was sent to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for sequential care.\nOn day 2, leg and pedal pulses were present as noted on clinical examination and arterial Doppler study. The patient was taken to the OT for a second look, with a large area of necrosis noted in the antero-medial part of the left leg. The skin flap used to cover the degloved area of the leg was completely removed, and the wound was extensively debrided and irrigated (). A bulky Jones dressing was applied, and she was taken to the ICU. As the vascular injury progressed satisfactorily, there was no longer any need for intervention by the vascular surgery team. The patient was transferred to the Orthopedic ward on day 7. She had sequential debridement every 48 to 72 h until the wound was considered adequate and there was no further risk of amputation either due to ischemia or infection. By day 21, the half-pin external fixator was exchanged by another one, not anymore spanning the knee joint (). On day 30, the half-pin external fixator was removed, and an Ilizarov circular frame was applied to hold the distal tibia in place until bone healing. No wound closure either using NPWT, flaps, or skin graft was done (). The patient remained hospitalized for continuous care and initiation of the rehabilitation protocol, including flat-foot weight bearing with crutches. There were no signs of ischemia or vascular insufficiency on the injured lower limb.\nOn day 60, the patient was discharged from the hospital with the Ilizarov fixator, showing obvious signs of adequate soft tissue healing of the extensive leg wound. Radiographs showed progression of bone healing, with a slight varus on the fracture site (). After 100 days since the index surgery, she had no distal neurovascular deficit, the tibia fracture and the leg wound were totally healed, and the patient was admitted for removal of the Ilizarov frame (). Radiographs showed malunited fractures of the left distal tibia and fibula, with 12° varus, 8° antecurvatum, and 5 mm shortening, which were judged unacceptable. The decision was for a scheduled corrective osteotomy without Ilizarov to fulfil the patient’s request.\nThe patient was re-admitted after 30 days for a one-stage corrective osteotomy of the malunited fractures. A 2 cm resection of the distal fibula was initially performed through a lateral longitudinal incision, followed by an oblique osteotomy of the distal tibia through an antero-medial approach. After anatomic alignment of the tibia axis in both planes, the osteotomy was fixed with a 3.5 mm cortical lag-screw and a neutralization small fragment non-locked reconstruction plate (). The osteotomy site healed uneventfully and with perfect alignment after 3 months, with no wound problem. At the last follow-up at 5 years, the range of motion of her left ankle and knee were completely recovered, except for a slight decrease (< 10°) in both ankle dorsiflexion and subtalar movement. There were no signs of arthritis. She complained of slight pain after extreme use, with normal function in work-related activities, and a normal gait without limping. Last consultation radiographs revealed a satisfactory alignment of the left leg on both planes (). According to the Reidsma et al. [] outcome score, she was rated with a good subjective and objective result: implicit mild pain with overuse, normal function in work-related activities, but restriction of strenuous activities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She was evaluated for a two-day history of intense diffuse headache and grade II lower limb edema, preceding a generalized tonic-clonic seizure that lasted approximately three minutes without any other associated sign or symptom. Physical examination performed on admission revealed eye-opening in response to verbal command, incomprehensible speech, withdrawal to pain, and mildly reactive isochoric pupils [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score: 9/15]. Vital signs were within normal limits (blood pressure was 118/72 mmHg).\nEclampsia or previously uncontrolled epilepsy were among our differentials. At the time, magnesium sulfate was initiated for neuroprotection. Later, our patient’s neurological status deteriorated (GCS score: 8/15), requiring endotracheal intubation. Furthermore, she developed new-onset elevated blood pressure (168/112 mmHg), which required intravenous antihypertensive management (labetalol 20 mg intravenously over two minutes followed by infusion of 1 mg/minute). Toxicological panels, immunologic workup, lumbar puncture, hematologic profile, urinary protein determination, and obstetric Doppler ultrasound were requested, which yielded normal results. Measurement of angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors was performed with results above the normal limits (Table ).\nBrain CT scan showed a poorly defined hypodense area and bilateral vasogenic edema in the occipital region, suggesting PRES. After 48 hours, her neurological status improved, although elevated blood pressure persisted. No other convulsive crisis or vasomotor symptoms were observed. A cesarean section was performed with no complications.\nCerebral MRI showed subcortical white matter edema in the posterior cerebral area, primarily on parieto-occipital regions and the right hemisphere. In addition to the clinical history and examination, these findings confirmed the PRES diagnosis in the patient (Figure ). After a week, blood pressure levels were controlled with antihypertensive medications, and the neurological status remained favorable. Subsequently, the patient was discharged from our institution with recommendations and a follow-up appointment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These episodes first started at the age of 6, increasing from 5 to almost 60-70 per night by the age of 16. No events occurred during wakefulness.\nHer mother first noticed poor coordination, disturbance of articulation and fine motor skills when the patient was three years old. Gait impairment and cognitive deterioration progressed over the course of the following years. At the time of admission, the patient was a college student, experiencing fatigue, attention decline, and affective lability that had a severe impact on her studies. Her family history was unremarkable.\nUpon admission, clinical examination revealed dolichocephaly, narrow forehead, thick eyebrows with synophris, hypertrichosis, prominent philtrum, broad nasal tip, and a thickened lower lip. Neurological examination revealed signs of moderate dysarthria and coordination impairment. Abdominal ultrasound exam revealed hepatomegaly. Brain MRI showed diffuse cerebral atrophy. The level of urinary glycosaminoglicans was increased up to 14.3mg/ mmol (normal range 0-8.3mg/mmol). Two compound heterozygous mutations were revealed in the NAGLU gene through whole-exome sequencing (hg19). Both mutations were identified in the proband and confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the family trio (parentage verified). The first proband’s mutation was identified in exon 6 of the NAGLU gene (chr17:40695951C>T; c.1927C>T, NM_0000263.3). This variant was maternally inherited. Second heterozygous mutation was identified in exon 1 of the NAGLU gene (chr17:40688599G>A, c.309G>A, p.Trp103Ter). This variant was paternally inherited. Based on these findings a diagnosis of mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type IIIB was made.\nOvernight video-EEG monitoring was performed, which captured 21 focal stereotyped motor seizures, characterized by sudden startled awakenings and irregular hypermotor activity in all four limbs (). The events were preceded by rhythmic fast activity over the frontal regions (). EEG monitoring also revealed interictal epileptiform activity in the frontal regions.\nBased on seizure semiology and EEG abnormalities the patient was diagnosed with SHE. The patient was started with carbamazepine 800mg/day (400mg b.i.d.), leading to over 80% drop in seizure frequency. After one month, daily dose of carbamazepine was slowly increased to 1,200mg/day followed by a substantial reduction in the number of seizures to 1-2 per week.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient had no significant past medical history and was an occasional cosmetic soft contact lenses wearer. The patient used to live in a rural area, had long unclean fingers’ nails, and worn contact lenses on the same day the symptoms had started. On eye examination, the visual acuity was 1.0 in the right eye and 0.1 in the left eye. The left eye showed a central 3 × 3 mm corneal ulcer and a 1 × 1 mm underlying corneal abscess with generalized corneal edema and a 1-mm hypopyon level in the anterior chamber. There was also associated mild eyelid edema and severe ciliary injection.\nA provisional diagnosis of infectious keratitis was considered. Under strict aseptic conditions, corneal scrapings were collected and inoculated directly onto sterile agar plates of bacterial and fungal culture media. The inoculated plates were promptly transported and delivered to the clinical microbiology laboratory (CML) for immediate incubation. The patient was admitted for therapy as well as close and frequent observations.\nThe therapeutic regimen included antimicrobial agents that were administered topically as hourly eye drops of fortified amikacin (aminoglycoside) and fortified vancomycin (glycopeptide), and systemically as 750 mg twice-daily oral ciprofloxacin (fluoroquinolone). Cyclopentolate hydrochloride 1% was also administered topically as hourly eye drops for relief of pain. On the next day, the patient was symptomatically improving. The corneal ulcer and abscess were the same size but the hypopyon was almost resolved. On the second day, the visual acuity had improved to 0.4, the ulcer was almost 2 × 2 mm and the abscess was 0.5 × 0.5 mm with the hypopyon completely disappeared. Corneal thinning at the site of the ulcer was noticed and intensive lubricating eye drops were added to the therapeutic regimen. The patient was discharged on the third day of the same treatment course.\nTwo days later, the patient was presented with a mild deterioration of vision. Despite the signs of clinical improvement, corneal melting was noticed at the site of the almost healed ulcer. All fortified eye drops were discontinued and replaced by moxifloxacin (fluoroquinolone) eye drops 4 times daily. Lubricating eye drops were continued hourly.\nOn further follow-up, the corneal defect had completely healed but thinning due to melting was obvious. Mild opacification of the cornea at the site of the previous ulcer had started to form. All eye drops other than lubricating agents were discontinued and the patient was stable in the follow-up visits.\nThe inoculated bacterial agar plates of Blood and MacConkey culture media (Oxoid, UK) were sterile and showed no bacterial growth after 48 hours of aerobic incubation at 34 to 36°C. The inoculated bacterial agar plates of Chocolate culture media (Oxoid, UK) were also sterile and showed no bacterial growth after 48 hours of incubation under 5% CO2 at 34 to 36°C.\nHowever after 5 days, identical fungal growths were detected on the inoculated fungal agar plates of Sabouraud Dextrose culture media (Oxoid, UK) incubated under aerobic conditions at 25°C, as well as on the other blood and chocolate agars kept on the laboratory bench. The isolated moderately fast-growing mold was identified as S brevicaulis based on both the macroscopic characteristic colony morphology and the microscopic observation of distinctive fungal elements. The colonies were off-white with powdery surface and feathery borders (Fig. ). Light microscopic examination of the colonies stained with lactophenol cotton blue showed hyaline septate hyphae, numerous branched conidiophores, and chains of rough thick-walled lemon-shaped conidia with flattened bases and rounded or slightly pointed tips (Fig. ).\nThe contact lens storing fluid was received and centrifuged, and the resulting sediment was cultured. Dark-colored soil debris from underneath the distal edges of the long fingers’ nails of the patient was also collected and cultured. The storing fluid's sediment and soil debris were inoculated onto separate Sabouraud dextrose agar plates, and the same etiologic mold S brevicaulis was isolated after 5 days of aerobic incubation at 25°C. The storing fluid's sediment and soil debris were also inoculated onto separate non-nutrient agar plates (Oxoid, UK) overlaid with Escherichia coli, and the plates were negative for trophozoites and cysts of the facultative protozoa Acanthamoebae.\nEthical approval by the institutional review board was not required because this is a case report. However a written informed consent was obtained from the patient to participate in this study.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mArY PRICe,18,F,B+,Diabetes,27-09-2019,Wendy Schultz,Garcia-Best,Medicare,20271.70694,137,Urgent,16-10-2019,Lipitor,Inconclusive,"This report concerns an 18-year-old female, known to have psoriasis vulgaris. The patient initially presented with the typical scaly inflammatory plaques, which were controlled with topical treatment in 2013. Despite her improvement at the time of diagnosis, the patient suffered from a severe relapse in 2018, in which the scaly plaques had involved 80% of her body. As an attempt to treat the flare-up, the patient was initiated on an anti-tumor necrosis factor, etanercept. The patient received the drug on a weekly basis, subcutaneously at a dose of 50 mg, for a period of seven months. Sequentially, the patient started to experience fever, night sweats, cough, dyspnea, and dysphagia. The symptoms were coincident with bilateral progressive supraclavicular swellings, which were increasing in size over a period of four months.\nClinical examination revealed the enlargement of cervical, supraclavicular, and submental nodes. The supraclavicular and cervical lymph nodes were tender upon palpation; however, the submental lymph node was non-tender and described as hard, immobile, with an estimated size of 1.3 cm. Skin examination findings were consistent with active psoriasis in which scaly patches on an erythematous base were reported. Other components of physical examination were insignificant.\nThe patient was suspected to have tuberculosis; however, the diagnosis was excluded due to the insignificance of the purified protein derivative and sputum culture results. Laboratory investigations revealed high C-reactive protein and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and other investigations were normal. The patient’s complaint was further investigated in October 2018 by a computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck and chest (Figure ). The radiological report was consistent with the patient’s presentation and clinical findings, in which the enlargement of different groups of lymph nodes, at multiple levels, above the diaphragm was recognized. The size of the greatest lymph node was measured to be 4.6 × 3 × 3 cm in the right supraclavicular group. Furthermore, the report stated that the findings of the CT scan are suggestive of lymphoma.\nIn November 2018, the patient was readmitted for biopsy; however, due to the heavy load on facilities, the biopsy was postponed to the following month. In December 2018, a right cervical lymph node was excised for biopsy under CT guidance. The pathological report denied the presence of malignant cells or granulomas from the provided sample. The report suggested reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and stated that the immunohistochemical markers CD15 and CD30 were absent.\nIn February 2019, the patient was readmitted to the medical ward to further investigate her lymphadenopathy. A CT scan showed further progression of the size of lymph nodes (Figure ). The report stated that the right submental lymph node was estimated to be 1.3 cm in size in the previous scan; however, it had grown to be 1.7 cm and was associated with a necrotic center. Although the lymph nodes in the left aortopulmonary window and right paratracheal region were also enlarged, the growth of the right axillary lymph nodes was of exceptional significance, in which the largest lymph node was estimated to be 2.6 cm in diameter. The scan also presented the mild compression that was applied on the trachea by the enlarged supraclavicular lymph nodes; however, it resumed its normal caliber in the mediastinum. The radiological report has also stated that there were no lung masses, nodules, or pleural effusion. It, however, suggested changes in the density of the liver, which may be indicating fatty liver changes. Thereby, it was recommended that the patient goes under further radiological studies, such as an abdominal and pelvic CT.\nIn October 2019, viral causes of lymphadenopathy such as Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and mumps were ruled out. CT scan was repeated and demonstrated further progression of the size of the lymph nodes, in addition to supraglottic narrowing as a result of mass effect (Figure ). Subsequently, the patient underwent a second excisional biopsy, as she started to experience significant unintentional weight loss, neck enlargement, dysphagia, altered voice, and further enlargement of the lymph nodes. The biopsy was taken from the right axillary lymph node. The pathological report confirmed the diagnosis of nodular sclerosis classical Hodgkin lymphoma stage IIIBSX. Contrary to the previous sample, the immunohistochemical markers CD15 and CD30 were positive. Fortunately, lymphoma was confined to the lymph nodes superior to the diaphragm.\nIn November 2019, the patient elected to be treated in a tertiary center given her logistics. We were allowed to access and trace her records. The other center ordered a positron emission tomography with 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-d-glucose integrated with computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) (Figure ). The patient’s condition was managed with six cycles of Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD). Fortunately, the patient underwent complete remission. We had a telephone conversation with the patient, and she expressed the fact of having no active skin lesions as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the time of admission, vital signs were as follows: body temperature = 36.8°C, systolic blood pressure = 80/60 mmHg, heart rate = 110/min, and O2 saturation = 80% without oxygenation. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 11. She was intubated and treated with vasopressors. Also, rales were heard on pulmonary auscultation. Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated sinus tachycardia (110/min) and low voltage QRS. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) indicated a small left ventricle (LV) with an end-diastolic dimension of 42 mm, a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 10% with global hypokinesis, a normal right ventricle (RV), and pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), no pericardial effusion (PE) or thrombosis, and no significant valve lesions or dysfunction. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGO) and basal consolidations (Figure ). Moreover, the patient had a positive nasal and oropharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for COVID-19. Laboratory findings are summarized in Table . The patient received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG; 1 g/kg), broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem [500 mg] and doxycycline [200 mg/day]), high-dose corticosteroid (methylprednisolone 1 g/day), and remdesivir for COVID-19.

She had also had low-grade fever (37.0–38.0 °C) for the previous 15 days. On neurological examination, she was fully alert and suspected neck rigidity, and the remainder of neurological examination was normal.\nAt the local hospital, she underwent cranial and lung computed tomography (CT) scans as well as gastroscopic examination, none of which showed any obvious abnormalities. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was first examined at the emergency department, and the results were normal except that the pressure was high (>400 mm H2O). Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) conducted at our hospital showed no obvious abnormalities either, although a suspicious enhanced signal was noted at the frontal and parieto-occipital regions of the scalp on both sides (Fig. ). Therefore, the patient was hospitalized with a diagnosis of IH.\nOn the further physical examination, multiple skin nodules were found on the abdomen. She had a family history of esophageal cancer (her grandfather and granduncle died of esophageal cancer). The results of serum tumor marker examination showed that both carcinoembryonic antigen (12.2 ng/mL) and cancer antigen 125 (43.7 U/mL) levels were mildly to moderately elevated. Other routine laboratory tests were normal (Supplementary Table 1). Abdominal CT showed multiple lymph nodes behind the peritoneum. A biopsy specimen was obtained from a subcutaneous nodule in the abdomen.\nFollow-up examination showed that the patient's headaches and visual complaints had progressively worsened, so we repeated lumbar puncture and CSF examination. At this time, the intracranial pressure was still very high (>400 mm H2O); further, the glucose content of the CSF was mildly elevated (4.50 mmol/L). After the second lumbar puncture, we increased the dosage of dehydrating agents, from 250 mL of glycerol fructose sodium chloride ivgtt Q12H and 125 mL mannitol ivgtt Q8H to 250 mL of glycerol fructose sodium chloride ivgtt Q12H and 125 mL mannitol ivgtt Q6H. Other treatments included agents for protecting the gastric mucosa and nutrition supplements. However the pathological results of the biopsy specimen showed invasive growth of malignant signet-ring cells (Fig. ). The results of immunohistochemical examination showed that she tested negative for CK7, synaptophysin (Syn), chromogranin A (CgA), Muc5AC, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), and Muc6; positive for CK20, Muc1, Muc2, E-cadherin, and p53; the Ki-67 index was about 87% (Fig. , Supplementary Table 2). To better understand the origin of the tumor, gastroscopic examination was performed, and the results showed multiple nodular hyperplasia accompanied by gastric ulcer. Pathological examination showed chronic mucosal inflammation in the big bend of the gastric antrum with small, focal signet-ring cells, confirming the diagnosis of signet-ring cell carcinoma. We also tested the autoimmune antibody series and paraneoplastic syndrome-related antibody in the CSF to determine the causes of the neurological symptoms, but both tests yielded negative results. The results of clinical laboratory examinations are given in Supplementary Table 1. The patient's prognosis was poor and her parents decided to give up treatment, choosing to return to their hometown the day after the gastroscopy.\nThis work was approved by the Department of Medicine of the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University and the informed consent was obtained.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only the coronary root canal was filled. Radiograph revealed that there was an accidental root perforation present and apical section of the root canal remained unfilled (). Internal resorption lacuna was visible in the middle third of the root. Patient's informed consent was obtained prior to endodontic retreatment explaining the rationale for treatment and possible alternatives. The basic requirement in the management of this case was the total removal of resorption granuloma. The procedure was performed under an operating microscope. Access cavity provided a view of the residual resorption granuloma that spontaneously perforated into the periodontal crevice together with failed root canal filling ().\nSimilarly to other types of resorption, calcium hydroxide was used as an intracanal medicament for three months. After the calcium hydroxide treatment was completed, both perforations (granuloma and root perforation) were covered with mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) material () and thermoplastic gutta-percha was used as a permanent root canal filling (). Root canal, resorption cavity, and root perforation were filled successfully. We used fiber-reinforced composite post to mechanically strengthen hard dental tissues ().

Her blood glucose was 22 mmol/L with an anion gap of 25 and lactate of 2.1 mmol/L. Urine tested positive for ketones. She complained of three days of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and stated that she had high blood sugars for days but did not take enough insulin and omitted a dose with her last meal. She had two prior admissions to hospital with DKA and was noted to have chronically suboptimal glucose control (hemoglobin A1C 11.3%). The patient was afebrile and blood and urine cultures were negative for bacteria.\nAfter one day in hospital with insulin and dextrose infusions, the anion gap closed and the patient was converted to subcutaneous insulin. However, the following day, plasma lactate levels were noted to be 3.9 mmol/L with an elevated anion gap. Insulin and dextrose infusions were restarted due to concerns of recurrent DKA. Due to persistent lactic acidosis and labor-intensive DKA management, the patient was moved to the ICU.\nUpon examination, the patient looked well. She was hemodynamically stable and afebrile and had no respiratory distress. She had no signs or symptoms of shock. Abdomen on palpation was soft, nondistended, and nontender. Liver was palpated at 8 cm below the costal margin with no palpable splenomegaly. Blood glucose was 5.8 mmol/L with an insulin infusion at 3 units/hour and 5% dextrose infusion at 100 mL/hour. Serum total bilirubin was 2 umol/L, ALT 36 U/L, alkaline phosphate was 120 U/L, and lipase was 12 U/L. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a liver span of 27 cm with hepatosteatosis and mild splenomegaly.\nSerial measurements of arterial blood gases revealed persistent lactic acidosis and anion gap despite insulin and dextrose infusions ().\nThe patient was transitioned from insulin infusion to subcutaneous insulin the following day. Her blood sugars stabilized in the range of 6–9 mmol/L and her last measured lactate was 5.3 mmol/L. She was discharged home with an endocrinologist referral for a suspected diagnosis of glycogenic hepatopathy and Mauriac syndrome.\nSubsequently, the patient underwent a chronic liver disease screen. Alpha-1 antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin, iron studies, viral hepatitis, celiac and immunological testing were normal. A FibroScan showed no evidence of hepatic fibrosis. After discharge, an abdominal ultrasound again revealed hepatomegaly with liver span of 24 cm. Mitochondrial disorder and respiratory chain defects were ruled out. A liver biopsy revealed numerous hepatocytes with glycogenated nuclei, abundant cytoplasmic and nuclear glycogen deposits, and no large droplet steatosis (). Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) stain was positive for glycogen accumulation (), which was abolished with diastase pretreatment (). Therefore, a diagnosis of Mauriac syndrome was given with the only manifestation being that of glycogenic hepatopathy with lactic acidosis. The patient was referred to a diabetes management clinic for further optimization of blood glucose.

Given the rarity of a hypoplastic ICA in NF1 patients, workup was initiated with particular attention given to alternate etiologies such as Moyamoya syndrome. The patient had a long-standing history of headaches, chronic left-greater-than-right vision loss, intermittent vertigo, numbness, tingling, and pain. A physical exam confirmed her visual symptoms and demonstrated 4+/5 right upper extremity weakness, hyporeflexia of the left triceps reflex, and diffuse café au lait spots. The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) imaging of the brain (Figures -).\nThe patient then underwent a diagnostic six-vessel cerebral angiogram (DCA) that demonstrated a complete left internal carotid occlusion distal to the branch of the ophthalmic artery. In addition, the entire left middle cerebral artery (MCA) and anterior cerebral artery (ACA) vascular territories were supplied by the right internal carotid via a robust anterior communicating artery (Figures -).\nThe findings on the DCA excluded the diagnosis of Moyamoya syndrome and further characterized the complete occlusive disease of her left carotid artery with total perfusion of her anterior circulation via the right ICA through a very robust anterior communicating artery. Moreover, a computerized tomography (CT) of her head revealed hypoplasia of the internal carotid canal suggesting a long-standing congenital lesion.

About 1 week later she developed intermittent fever (up to 39 °C), general malaise, headaches, meningism, fluctuating diplopia on right gaze, and subtle psychomotor slowing, for which she was admitted to the Department of Neurology, Charité – University Medicine Berlin. The day after admission, her condition deteriorated and she additionally noted weakness of her legs, urinary incontinence, respiratory impairment with difficulty in coughing, and mild dysphagia. On neurologic examination the patient was awake and oriented. Cranial nerve examination showed no abnormalities, but she had marked dysarthria and reported fluctuating horizontal diplopia. Her legs were plegic and she had reduced pain and touch sensation below T10. There was also British Medical Research Council (BMRC) grade 4 distal weakness in both arms. Deep tendon reflexes were preserved throughout. Except for a mature cystic ovarian teratoma without signs of malignancy, which had been removed 2 months before, her past medical history was unremarkable. N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antibodies were negative. Spinal MRI demonstrated a prominent, longitudinally extensive, T2-hyperintense and centrally located lesion without contrast enhancement extending over almost the entire spinal cord, as well as swelling of the cord (Fig. ). Cranial MRI showed T2-hyperintense lesions in the frontal and parietal subcortical white matter, the pontine tegmentum, and the cerebellar peduncles without contrast enhancement (Fig. ). Thoracic and abdominal MRI revealed a right retroperitoneal mass with a diameter of 5.6 cm, which was resected 5 months later and found to be a ganglioneuroma. CSF analysis on the day of admission demonstrated an elevated total cell count with 306 white blood cells/μl (reference range <5/μl) with 80.2 % lymphocytes, 8.2 % monocytes, 7 % neutrophils, 2.4 % eosinophils, and 2.2 % activated lymphocytes, but no plasma cells or tumor cells. CSF lactate was elevated at 28.4 mg/dl (reference range <20 mg/dl). There was moderate blood--CSF barrier (BCSFB) dysfunction with an albumin CSF/serum ratio (QAlb) of 30.6 × 10-3 (age-adjusted upper limit of normal 5.2 × 10-3). Accordingly, total CSF protein was elevated (213 mg/dl; reference range <45 mg/dl). She had no local IgG synthesis and no CSF-specific OCB.\nRoutine serum chemistry including C-reactive protein (CRP) showed normal results. A complete blood count revealed mild leukocytosis (12.44/nl; reference range <11/nl). Extensive microbiological (herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus, Epstein--Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, human herpes virus 6, enteroviruses, influenza A virus, adenovirus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, human immunodeficiency virus, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1, Borrelia, Treponema pallidum, Brucella, Bartonella, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Aspergillus) work-up detected no signs of acute CNS infection.\nAntinuclear antibodies were detectable at a titer of 1:1280, but antibodies to double-stranded DNA, extractable nuclear antigens, onconeuronal antigens (Hu, Yo, Ri, CV2/CRMP5, Ma2/Ta, amphiphysin), cardiolipin, β2-glycoprotein, phosphatidyl serine, gangliosides (GD1a, GD1b GM1, GM2, GM3, GQ1b, GT1b [IgG and IgM in each case]), and aquaporin-4 were negative, as were anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Screening of serum and CSF for antibodies against NMDA receptors (IgG, IgA, IgM), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, glycine receptor, myelin-associated antigen, and glutamic acid decarboxylase was likewise negative.\nHowever, testing of a serum sample obtained on the day of admission in a live-cell CBA demonstrated high-titer serum IgG antibodies against MOG (1:10240). Anti-MOG antibodies were also detectable in the CSF (1:64), but there was no evidence of intrathecal production of anti-MOG antibodies, with an anti-MOG antibody index (AI) of 0.3 (reference range <4) [].\nThe patient was initially treated with ceftriaxone and ampicillin, which was discontinued after a bacterial infection was ruled out, as well as with IVMP (1 g/day for 6 days). Corticosteroids were thereafter administered orally (prednisolone 100 mg/d), slowly tapered, and eventually stopped in October 2010. Starting on the day after admission, she was additionally treated with a total of 10 PEX. MOG-IgG was retrospectively detectable also in PEX plasma (titer 1:320 after three exchanges). Thereafter, therapy with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG, 2 g/kg body weight) was initiated in July 2010. IVIG therapy was continued at 5-week intervals until June 2011, with dose reduction to 1 g/kg body weight from January 2011 onwards. The patient gradually recovered and was able to walk with a walking frame by August 2010. Follow-up spinal MRI in August 2010 demonstrated resolution of the longitudinal extensive lesion, but there were several residual patchy hyperintense lesions within the spinal cord. In a serum sample obtained at the same time, the anti-MOG antibody titer was clearly lower (1:640) than the initial titer, and anti-MOG antibodies were no longer detectable in CSF.\nThe patient did not receive any further immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapy. At the last follow-up examination, 28 months after disease onset and 16 months after discontinuation of IVIG, she reported no further relapses and had no impairments in activities of daily living except for residual unsteadiness when walking for a longer time, difficulties on running for more than 5 min, and slightly increased urinary frequency (EDSS 1). Neurologic examination showed a very mild residual right-sided pyramidal syndrome with brisk tendon reflexes, but was otherwise unremarkable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BReNDA bROwn,18,F,O+,Obesity,20-07-2020,James Richardson,PLC Keller,Blue Cross,6130.440254,358,Elective,01-08-2020,Ibuprofen,Inconclusive,"An 18-year-old woman first presented for medical attention due to primary amenorrhoea. She was then a tall, thin woman with female external genitalia and no vulval or inguinal masses, however breast development and secondary sexual hair were conspicuously absent. The karyotype was 46,XY leading to a presumptive diagnosis of CAIS. Because of the suspicion of cryptorchid, dysgenetic gonads with high malignant potential, the patient underwent open laparotomy revealing streak gonads which were removed, and an infantile uterus which was left in situ. Histopathology demonstrated bilateral gonadoblastoma, and dysgerminoma in the right gonad. She received abdominopelvic radiotherapy with no tumour recurrence. After gonadectomy, she was commenced on the oral contraceptive pill and later changed to lower dose hormone replacement therapy.\nAt age 46 years, the patient migrated to Australia and sought review at our institution. Her active medical issues included type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, obstructive defecation syndrome and colonic polyps. She had a tall, slim build with a body-mass index of 20.4 kg/m2 and her proportions were eunuchoid with height 181 cm, arm span 182 cm and lower segment length 102 cm. There was minimal pubic hair and no axillary hair, but breast development was now normal. She had female external genitalia and a retroverted uterus.\nResults of hormonal studies and haematocrit were most consistent with hypogonadal female ranges (Table ). Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry demonstrated mild osteopenia with T-scores of -1.1 at the hip and spine. Because of menorrhagia, she underwent transvaginal ultrasound which demonstrated a fibroid within an hypoplastic uterus (Fig. ). No renal tract anomalies were seen. After failed hysteroscopy and multiple alterations in hormone replacement, she was treated with transdermal oestradiol 25 mcg/hr and oral norethisterone 5 mg daily with cessation of menses at age 48 years.\nIt was now, in the patient’s fifth decade of life, that her original diagnosis of CAIS was questioned. Whilst the external female phenotype, XY karyotype and absence of secondary sexual hair were consistent with CAIS, the presence of streak gonads and functioning Müllerian structures along with the absence of spontaneous breast development favoured a diagnosis of CGD. Though Müllerian remnants have been observed in women with CAIS, there are no reports of the functioning uterine structures as found in our patient. We performed various genetic studies locally, beginning with a digital karyotype confirming the original 46,XY result. FISH demonstrated an intact SRY gene, excluding SRY deletion as the cause of the patient’s atypical DSD. Array comparative genomic hybridisation showed no copy number variation at an average effective resolution of 0.2 MB.\nThe major genetic possibilities at this stage were sequence variants and copy number variations in known CGD genes such as DHH, SRY, NR5A1 and NR0B1 []. In keeping with the patient’s original diagnosis overseas, synergistic mutations in AR and AMH or AMHR2 were considered possible, as this would theoretically result in an unvirilised XY female phenotype with intact Müllerian structures. Whole exome sequencing was contemplated as the next step in our genetic evaluation, however this was deemed less suitable due to the non-contiguous capture and amplification steps which may hinder identification of copy number variations which are a significant cause of CGD []. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array was an alternative as its utility has been established in DSD [], however the genetic resolution is low and does not allow for diagnosis of point mutations []. We instead opted for whole genome sequencing (WGS) in order to examine all susceptibility genes simultaneously and at high resolution. WGS was also favoured because of its capacity to detect copy number variations as the entire genome is contiguously analysed, allowing the detection of DNA breakpoints in cases of genetic deletions and duplications [].\nWGS was performed using the Illumina HiSeq X Ten Sequencing system at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research (). Bioinformatic analysis was performed at the SA Pathology Molecular Genetics Laboratory with variant classification by the American College of Medical Genetics 5-tier system: benign, likely benign, uncertain significance, likely pathogenic, or pathogenic [].\nVariants found on WGS were filtered based on mutational consequence (snpEff impact high or moderate) and phenotypic correlation. WGS revealed variants in eight genes associated with disorders of sexual development, namely: AKR1C4, DMRT1, MAP2K1, MAP3K1, NR0B1, NR5A1, POR and SRY. All but the NR0B1 and SRY variants were excluded based on variant population frequencies >1 % in the 1000 Genomes (1 K), Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) and Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) databases. The NR0B1 variant was then excluded because of a population frequency >1 % amongst individuals in the ExAC database of the same ethnicity as the patient.\nThe remaining hemizygous missense variant in the SRY gene (NM_003140.2, p.Arg130Pro, c.389G > C) was confirmed to be present on Sanger sequencing of SRY. This variant has not been previously reported in the 1K, ESP, ExAC, or dbSNP databases, although there is an enrichment of pathogenic missense mutations at other locations of SRY reported in the ClinVar database (Fig. ). It is located at the 3’ end of the HMG box domain in a region required for nuclear localisation (UniProt Q05066) and it is predicted to be pathogenic by PolyPhen2 and MutationTaster, but not SIFT. It is moderately conserved (phyloP 3.43, CADD 10.44) and has a moderate Grantham difference of 103. Protein-DNA complex modelling demonstrated that substitution of arginine (Arg) to proline (Pro) causes steric hindrances to the native SRY protein structure which may affect DNA binding (Fig. and ).\nThe evidence collectively demonstrated this novel SRY variant to be likely pathogenic, which is consistent with a diagnosis of 46,XY DSD (OMIM 400044), and more specifically CGD, thus revising the patient’s diagnosis from CAIS to CGD 30 years after her original presentation. The patient’s Müllerian structures were now considered a consistent feature of her DSD, although the reason for the absence of secondary sexual hair remains unclear as we excluded a concomitant mutation in the AR gene on WGS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ten days before, she had been diagnosed with acute pharyngotonsillitis and had started a 7-day amoxicillin/clavulanic acid course (1 g bid), obtaining only partial relief of the throat pain. On examination, the patient was febrile (38.2°C); neck palpation revealed tender lymph nodes in the right anterior cervical chain. The tonsils were enlarged but not erythematous; breath sounds were diminished over the right lung base. Examination of the abdomen revealed slight splenomegaly. The diagnostic suspicion was oriented toward infectious mononucleosis and, after the collection of blood samples for laboratory tests, the patient was discharged home with the prescription of paracetamol. Laboratory tests showed neutrophilic leukocytosis (white blood cells count 11.56 × 109/L, neutrophils 93%), low platelet count (61.00 × 109/L), and elevated C-reactive protein (25.9 mg/dL). Serological tests for EBV, CMV, and HIV were negative. An unexpectedly high procalcitonin value (294 ng/mL) raised the suspicion of bacterial sepsis and elicited an urgent hospitalization in our internal medicine ward for diagnostic and therapeutic management. On presentation, the patient was alert, hypotensive (BP 100/60 mmHg), and tachycardic (115 bpm); body temperature was 38.7°C; respiratory rate was 17, with oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. A chest X-ray showed a faint retrocardiac opacity and raised the suspicion of a community acquired pneumonia. After drawing two sets of blood culture (aerobic, anaerobic), an empirical treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin was started. Two days later, the patient was still febrile and mildly lethargic, with toxic appearance. Blood cultures grew gram negative bacilli, and amikacin was added to ceftriaxone. The next day, Fusobacterium necrophorum, an anaerobic gram negative rod, was identified as responsible for the bloodstream infection, and the antibiotic treatment was changed to intravenous metronidazole and meropenem. Based on this microbiological finding, a neck ultrasound exam was performed, showing a nonoccluding parietal thrombosis of the right internal jugular vein. Diagnosis of Lemierre's syndrome was ultimately confirmed by a contrast enhanced CT scan of the neck and the thorax. This showed a small right parapharyngeal abscess, thrombosis of the right internal jugular vein (), and multiple peripheral lung nodules, expression of septic embolization (Figures , , and ). Anticoagulation with subcutaneous enoxaparin was prescribed (4,000 UI bid); subsequently, the patient was transferred to the High Dependency Unit for haemodynamic monitoring. Five days later, the body temperature became steadily normal and blood tests showed a sharp decline of procalcitonin (2.11 ng/mL) and C-reactive protein (2.3 mg/dL), an increase of platelet count (428.00 × 109/L), and the negativization of microbial cultures. The patient was discharged home after a 2-week course of intravenous antibiotic treatment. She received an outpatient oral treatment with metronidazole and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for 14 days and a 3-month course of enoxaparin, experiencing an uneventful recovery. A control CT scan showed the complete resolution of lung opacities and pleural effusion (Figures , , and ).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pain began gradually during her strenuous sporting practice hours earlier, limiting her ability to participate. She localized the pain to her lower abdomen, describing it both as similar to menstrual cramps and reminiscent of her appendicitis 3 years ago. Hours later, she experienced nausea and emesis. She found pain relief when crouching, exacerbation during emesis and micturition, and no relief with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\nShe was previously healthy and physically active, with no surgical history besides an uncomplicated appendectomy. Menarche was at 12-years old and her menstrual cycles were regular, not painful, and occurred every 60 days. She was previously sexually active, with no history of sexually transmitted infections. Her last menstrual period was 7 months prior to her current symptoms. She had a 3-year history of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) use for contraception. Her family and social history were otherwise non-contributory.\nOn examination, both her lower abdominal quadrants were severely tender to light and deep palpation, without rigidity, rebound tenderness, or palpable masses. A pelvic examination was not performed. She was afebrile; her vital signs were age appropriate and stable. A complete blood count showed an elevated white blood cell count at 16.4×103/μL (reference range 3.8 to 11.0) with no left shift on automated differential. Her pregnancy test was negative. The ED provider listed menstrual cramps as the main differential diagnosis at the time and she was sent for pelvic ultrasonography.\nTransabdominal and transvaginal pelvic ultrasound (Fig. ) was performed and her uterus was measured to be 7.1×4.6×5.4 cm. The endometrium was distended with homogenous echogenic fluid. No discrete mass or congenital anomaly was identified. Her left and right ovaries were of appropriate size with normal echotexture and blood flow bilaterally. She was discharged home with next day Obstetrics and Gynecology (OB/GYN) follow-up and no new findings were reported on subsequent examination. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; Fig. ) was then performed which revealed a fluid-filled endometrial cavity and endocervical canal; however, the canal appeared to be non-dilated at 1 to 2 mm. Hematometra was suspected at this time. Again, there were no discrete obstructing mass or congenital anomaly identified on imaging.\nShe was scheduled for hysteroscopy followed by fractional dilatation and curettage under general anesthesia. During the procedure, her cervix was sequentially dilated up to 8 mm using a Hegar dilator. Her cervix did not appear to be constricted. A large amount of old bloody material was expelled from her cervix upon dilation and after entrance into her uterine cavity with a hysteroscope. The old bloody material was washed out with sterile saline. Her uterine lining could then be visualized and was noted to be pale and thin, consistent with her history of DMPA use. Both ostia were present and there were no masses or other abnormalities upon visualization. Dilation and curettage by endocervical and endometrial curettings was performed and tissue was sent for pathology. She tolerated the procedures well.\nThe pathology of her endocervix showed normal benign tissue. The endometrium showed benign inactive to weakly proliferative endometrium and the lower uterine segment had scattered plasma cells consistent with chronic endometritis along with patchy mild nonspecific acute inflammation.\nHer symptoms were resolved by the procedure and her 6-month follow-up showed no recurrence of hematometra or other complications. Her DMPA was discontinued at the same time and she switched to oral contraception.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At first evaluation by the pediatric surgery team, a Gastroschisis Prognosis Score of 1 was given. A ward reduction and suture-less closure was done in the neonatal intensive care unit during the first hours of life without the need of mechanical ventilation. Total parenteral nutrition was started through a PICC line the next day. Enteral feed was started at the 7th day of life, achieving total enteral feeding on the 13th day of life. She presented cholestasis [direct bilirubin (DB) 4 mg/dl] with acholic stools at the second week of life. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy demonstrated an intrahepatic cholestasis pattern with bile passing into the bowel. At 1 month of age abdominal distention with ascites appeared, a paracentesis obtained a milky yellow fluid. On peritoneal fluid analysis, triglycerides were 434mg/dL, proteins 3934mg/dL and high leukocytes count 1870mm3 with 97% monocytes, confirming the diagnosis of chylous ascites. Initial treatment was begun with enteral formula low in triglycerides (Deilem®) and octreotide (2μg/kg/h) without response to treatment. A new paracentesis was required because of abdominal distension with respiratory distress, fluid like the previously was obtained. After the second paracentesis, feces started to have green color and the DB normalized. Octreotide was increased daily by 1μg/kg/hour until 10μg/kg/hour. At the third week of treatment, octreotide was decreased progressively, and enteral feeding was started at 24ml/kg/day with Deilem® supplemented with medium-chain triglycerides (MCT).

Inflammation of the pulmonary parenchyma was revealed by a thoracic CT examination (Fig. ). Antiinfectious treatment with sulbenicillin sodium, moxifloxacin, and vidarabine monophosphate was initiated. Klebsiella pneumoniae was found in the sputum 3 days later. Antimycoplasma (MP) pneumoniae IgM antibody in serum was negative. Lobar pneumonia was diagnosed finally combined with the typical clinical manifestations including high fever, cough, rusty colored stuff, and chest pain and the radiological characteristics of inflammation of the pulmonary parenchyma. Five days later, she told her family that some people were on the wall and roof. Meanwhile, she waved her right upper limb without purpose. Then she was transferred to the Department of Neurology. On physical examination, she was fully alert and oriented. Her right upper limb waved irregularly for 15 or 20 times each hour. The tendon reflex of the lower limbs was weakened. The Babinski sign was absent bilaterally. Laboratory investigations including routine blood test, liver, and renal functions revealed slightly increased neutrophilic granulocyte (NE%) (0.77, normal range: 0.4–0.75), hyponatremia (132.8 mmol/L, normal range: 137–147 mmol/L), mildly elevated levels of lactic dehydrogenase (292 U/L, normal range: 135–226 U/L), and α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (232 U/L, normal range: 78–182 U/L). Reexamined the anti-MP pneumoniae IgM antibody in serum was positive (1:160) after she developed mental abnormalities. The Mantoux test was negative. The results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): the level of protein was 0.23 g/L (normal range: 0.15–0.45 g/L), white blood cell was 3×10 ^6/L (0–8 × 10 ^6/L), glucose was 3.76 mmol/L (2.3–4.1 mmol/L), and the culture of CSF was negative. Examination and electroencephalogram were normal. Cranial MRI was performed immediately after she presented with mental abnormalities. A focal splenial lesion in the corpus callosum was identified, which presented as homogeneous hypointensity on T1 weighted imaging (T1WI) and hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) (Fig. ). The lesion appeared hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and showed restricted diffusion on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map (Fig. ). The patient's psychiatric symptoms were significantly improved after 1-week antiinfection and nerve-nurturing treatment with trivitamin B and Xingnaojing for the neurological symptoms. A follow-up examination of cranial MRI (Fig. ) 15 days later revealed complete resolution of the lesion.

She underwent feminizing surgery (clitoroplasty) at 5 years of age. Due to limited parental understanding of the condition, medication adherence was extremely poor. Presumably secondary to the resulting androgen exposure and related virilization, AA’s gender role behavior was masculinized since the age of 7 years, and the patient was adamant about being a “boy.” However, the parents insisted that AA wear female clothes and behave as a girl, which caused much family conflict. AA never attained menarche and refused to see a gynecologist to whom she was referred to settle the menstrual problem. Her gender issues included the refusal to pray, as she refused to wear the female Muslim praying attire and demanded to sit with the men at religious functions, and the desire to marry a girl and be a good husband.\nOnce she became a legal adult at the age of 18 years, she formally requested to change her gender to male. This resulted in a multidisciplinary meeting with the patient, her family, and the doctors involved in her care. Her case was then presented to the National Shariah Council of Malaysia.

Frontal cephalalgia was described as stabbing; photosensitivity, phonophobia, nausea, and vomit were absent. She complained from a stinging low back pain reduced by the left lateral decubitus position.\nOn admission the girl was suffering; discomfort while sitting in her wheelchair was evident; her cephalalgia and low back pain intensity were both 8-9/10 NRS (numeric rating scale). On physical examination, she presented scaphocephaly, short neck, and convex right dorsal and convex left lumbar scoliosis, with an accentuated reduction of lumbar lordosis and deformity of the sternum. Generalized muscle hypotonia and moderate muscular weakness were present. At inspection, straight cervical rachis was evident; it was associated with severe limitation of range of motion (ROM); no pain was reported during active and passive mobilization at that level. Back pain was raised by acupressure of dorsal and lumbar spinal apophysis and palpation of right lumbar paravertebral muscles. Retraction of hip flexors and hamstring muscles was present. Neither irradiation to lower limbs nor paresthesias were present. Blood phlogosis markers were not altered. Brain and rachis MRI showed many anomalies: cortical atrophy and gliosis in frontal and temporal sites, diameter reduction of spinal canal at C1–D7 levels (hourglass aspect of lower brainstem and upper spinal cord), diffuse herniated disks with spinal cord compression, and L5-S1 anterior spondylolisthesis.\nOn admission, patient's therapy was the following: morphine (0,3 mg/kg × 4/day, po) and betamethasone (0,017 mg/kg × 2/day, po), started 6 months ago. Lateral rachis radiography and DXA (Dual Energy X-ray absorptiometry) were performed to exclude vertebral fractures. After our examination morphine dosage was increased to 0,4 mg/kg × 4/day while betamethasone was continued at the same dose. Pain monitoring was performed thanks to scheduled phone calls. After few weeks, while low back pain intensity decreased, cephalalgia worsened.\nFor this reason she referred to a pain center near her home; in that occasion, suspecting a left trigeminal neuralgia due to GAG accumulation, steroid and anaesthetic subcutaneous infusions administered locally (once a week, for 3 months) were performed without success. Corticosteroid and morphine therapy were continued.\nOn her second admission to our service in March 2015, she continued to report severe cephalalgia (NRS 9/10) with hyperalgesia in left periorbital site and moderate low back pain (5-6/10) with paresthesia in the legs. Morphine (0,5 mg/kg × 6/day, po) was associated with gabapentin (up to 10 mg/kg × 3/day, po), while betamethasone was suspended. After one month, the patient reported a reduction of pain in periorbital site (NRS from 9/10 to 4/10).\nA new antalgic evaluation was requested in March 2016: low back pain and cephalalgia were still present despite the consumption of morphine for a long time. In this occasion morphine was stopped and Fentanyl patch (1,7 mcg/kg/h every 72 hours) was started suggesting a supplementary Fentanyl transmucosal dose (400 mcg) at need. Amitriptyline and gabapentin were also recommended to treat the neuropathic component of pain but also this pharmacological approach failed. During treatment, the patient presented side effects (difficult urination, nausea, and drowsiness) related to opioid use. At this point, considering the poor analgesic efficacy of morphine and the severe side effects, a cannabinoid therapy was started: 8 mg/kg × 2/die in decoction. After few weeks cephalalgia and opioid side effects vanished. However, she continued assumption of morphine at need (10 mg per os) and betamethasone (0.25 mg/die). We monitored her pain by phone: 1 month and 2 months after the beginning of cannabinoid use, well-being and no side effects were reported.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She had chronic swelling of her face and abdomen at baseline. She was initially stabilized by epinephrine and steroids. She experienced multiple prior episodes of anaphylactic reactions at least twice weekly for which she was evaluated in our emergency room and treated per a standard protocol in place for her given the frequency of her visits.\nAt age 15, she had significant asthma symptoms and was found to have a mildly elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE) level. Prior skin testing resulted in vomiting, dehydration, and hospitalization. She was diagnosed as having food protein-induced enterocolitis with severe anaphylaxis to eggs after undergoing a food challenge test. A bone marrow biopsy was inconclusive without evidence of mastocytosis and the KIT-D816V mutation. Her serum tryptase level was normal between episodes and was elevated to 26.5 ng/ml during flare ups. Her plasma prostaglandin-D2 and 24-hour urine 11 betaprostaglandin-F2 levels were markedly elevated during episodes. A C1 esterase inhibitor test was negative.\nShe was previously treated with steroids, multiple H1 and H2 antihistamines (diphenhydramine 300 mg daily, loratadine 10 mg daily, cetirizine 10 mg daily, fexofenadine 120 mg daily, and famotidine 80 mg daily), omalizumab (one-time dose of 300 mg), and a monoclonal antibody that inhibited IgE binding to mast cells, which unfortunately also resulted in anaphylaxis. To stress the seriousness of the situation, she had a severe anaphylactic reaction resulting in cardiac arrest with successful resuscitation.\nOf interest, the University of Minnesota recommended the use of CDI based on ongoing research that had shown some efficacy. She was admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) and started on a diphenhydramine infusion at 5 mg/hour. Then, the infusion was increased by 2 mg every 2 hours with a target goal of 15 mg/hour. This approach led to a decrease in the episode frequency to one to two times a month, which felt like a miracle to the patient. Based on ongoing research, we started imatinib at 100 mg once daily and titrated up to 400 mg once daily, because this treatment had evidence of use in patients negative for the KIT-D816V mutation. This approach led to a further increase in intervals between episodes to once every 2 to 3 months. Therefore, our patient can enjoy months before an episode occurs, which is a new scenario for this patient in particular.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lesions mostly started as painful erythematous papules and nodules on any site of the body following some constitutional symptoms such as fever and weakness. These lesions then quickly progressed to hemorrhagic deep ulcers resolving with depressed scar tissue either spontaneously or with nonspecific antibiotic therapies between 3 to 4 weeks. For the last 6-month duration, lesions appeared more frequently. She had no family history of similar lesions or other systemic diseases. On physical examination, there were multiple painful ulcers with necrotic base in different sizes scattered all over the body and numerous round atrophic scars (more than one hundred). She has no constitutional symptoms and palpable lymphadenopathy. The skin biopsy revealed regular acanthotic epidermis, a dense dermal infiltrate of pleomorphic atypical lymphoid cells, and destruction of the blood vessels' walls by abnormal lymphocytes (Figures and ). Biopsy revealed abnormal lymphocytes which were predominantly positive for CD30 () and mostly CD8+ lymphoid cells, especially angiocentric infiltrates. When we closely look at the entire infiltrate, which is both angiocentric and interstitial, an overall predominance of CD8+ cells over CD4+ cells was seen. CD20, CD56, and CD21 were negative. Perforin was negative and granzyme was focal positive. In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA and Latent Membrane Protein 1 (LMP1) was negative. T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement could not be performed. Based on the clinical history, physical examination, and histological findings, diagnosis of LyP type E was established.\nHematologic laboratory and routine biochemistry workup showed no sign for systemic malignancy nor other systemic diseases. Chest/abdomen/pelvis computed tomography revealed irregular hyperdense areas on skin and subcutaneous tissue and multiple small (<1 cm) lymphadenopathies but neither hepatosplenomegaly nor other abnormalities were seen. On PET examination abdominal, axillary, inguinal, and cervical small hypermetabolic lymph nodes have been detected. Histopathological examination of a posterior cervical lymph node and bone marrow biopsy yielded unremarkable findings.\nAs the patient has severe course with multiple devastating ulcerative lesions and frequent recurrences, we administered methotrexate with a dose of 15 mg per week. During 3-month follow-up, we observed a relative decrease in the appearance of new lesions. The dose of methotrexate was increased to 20 mg per week. After one month she had a severe recurrence of the disease while on treatment, and the dose was increased to 35 mg per week. However, the liver enzymes were elevated with this approach. The dose of methotrexate had to be discontinued. She was given IFN alfa-2a with a dose of 6 mU three times per week. After two-month treatment with IFN alfa-2a, she was finally feeling well and there were no new lesions and all previous persistent lesions were healed completely (Figures , , and ). A slight leucopenia was observed. Since clinical remission was achieved, the treatment schedule was switched to 6 mU IFN alfa-2a 2 times per week. For the time being the disease has been maintaining its remission status for six months.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She was born premature and dysmature (gestational age 31 weeks + 5 days, birth weight 1210 g) to consanguineous parents. She had a good start but a very low blood glucose level directly after birth (0.2 mmol/L); this was corrected with an intravenous glucose infusion, and there was no further hypoglycemia in the neonatal period. She had mild bilateral eyelid ptosis from birth. Psychomotor development was normal. During childhood, she had a history of recurrent airway infections and bronchitis, mild failure to thrive, and mild anemia for which she visited a general pediatrician regularly. At age 4 years, routine serum creatinine measurements were 58 μmol/L, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. The lower than expected eGFR escaped the attention of the local pediatrician, and it was only at age 15 years, during routine testing, that a mildly elevated serum creatinine was noted for the first time (106 μmol/L, eGFR 53 ml/min/1.73 m2). At age 18 years, the serum creatinine level had increased to 139 μmol/L (eGFR 48 ml/min/1.73 m2), and she was referred to our university hospital for further examination. At that time, she reported exercise intolerance and lightheadedness on rising in the morning. Physical examination showed a height of 1.56 m (−2 standard deviations [SD]), a weight of 60 kg (+1SD), and a supine blood pressure of 106/55 mmHg; results were normal for heart, lungs, and abdomen examination, and, with the exception of the eyelid ptosis, for the neurological examination. Her symptoms and signs, especially the exercise intolerance and eyelid ptosis, raised the suspicion of a mitochondrial disorder. Laboratory investigations showed normal values for serum lactate and electrolytes (Na+ 140 mmol/L, K+ 4.4 mmol/L, Ca2+ 2.2 mmol/L, Mg2+ 0.75 mmol/L, P3− 1.33 mmol/L). There was no proteinuria nor hematuria. Kidney size and structure were normal on the renal ultrasound images. In order to obtain a diagnosis, we performed a renal biopsy. Light microscopic examination revealed a few vascular sclerosed glomeruli with only discrete interstitial fibrosis. Electron microscopic examination revealed notable abnormal, fused mitochondria in the proximal tubules but not in the distal tubules (Fig. ). This prompted the performance of a muscle biopsy for further evaluation of a mitochondrial defect. However, muscle histology was normal, and extensive biochemical testing of the respiratory chain also did not show any evidence of a mitochondrial disorder []. Mutation analysis of mitochondrial DNA was performed in leucocytes and muscle tissue, but did not show any abnormalities. At that time, current techniques, such as whole exome sequencing, were not yet available, and so the patient was managed further by our department without a classifying diagnosis. At age 19 years, she fainted while her height was being measured during a routine visit to the outpatient clinic. She reported that she was increasingly suffering from dizziness, especially in the morning. Orthostatic blood pressure measurements were performed, showing severe orthostatic hypotension with preserved heart rate increase. Her blood pressure decreased from supine values of 116/76 mmHg (heart rate 54 bpm) to 56/30 mmHg (heart rate 84 bpm) after standing for 3 min. Upon asking, she reported that sweating was normal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient had history of insertion of plastic pen through vagina 6 months earlier for sexual gratification. There was no history of continuous leakage of urine per vagina. She informed history of normal menstruation. There was no associated psychiatric illness. Laboratory investigations such as electrolyte profile and blood count were normal but routine urine analysis showed pyuria and microscopic hematuria. General physical examination revealed no abnormality. On per vaginal and speculum examination, a pointed object was felt at anterior vaginal wall with no continuous leakage of urine from vagina. The digital rectal examination was normal. Plain X-ray pelvis was normal. Contrast enhanced computed tomography showed a 10.2 x 1.2cm hypodense linear object piercing the anterior vaginal wall and left posterior bladder wall with majority of its part lying inside the bladder. The tip of the foreign body pierced right to anterior bladder wall and reached the abdominal wall () with normal upper tracts, uterus and ovaries. Cystoscopy showed encrusted plastic pen inside the bladder extending from right anterior bladder wall up to the left posterior bladder wall () with a small portion of pen (approximately mm) protruding through anterior vaginal wall visualized on vaginoscopy.

There was no fever, cough, chest pain, hemoptysis, and dyspnea accompanying with the pain. The patient denied any history of smoking, alcohol consumption, exposure to tuberculosis, or tumor. There was no weight loss since onset. Her family history was unremarkable. No positive findings were obtained in the chest exam. Thus, the patient was sent for medical imaging examinations.\nChest X-ray showed a well-demarcated left mediastinal mass (Fig. ). Non-contrast chest CT (Fig. , ) revealed a well-defined heterogeneous mass (measuring 39 mm × 35 mm × 41 mm) deeply located in the posterior mediastinum, extending from thoracic vertebrae D4 to D5. Compression of the lung and destruction of the posterior end of the left fifth rib were visualized (Fig. ). On the contrast-enhanced CT, the tumor manifested obviously inhomogeneous enhancement (Fig. , ), furthermore, extension of the tumor through the intervertebral foramen into the spinal canal was distinctly displayed (Fig. ). Mild pleural effusion was also observed in the left pleural cavity.\nMRI provided more information on the observation of the inner components of the tumor due to the higher soft tissue resolution compared to CT. On the T2-weighted images (TR/TE, 4300/97 ms) (Fig. –), the tumor appeared a heterogeneous mass, whose main component was solid, mixed with small portion of cysts with different sizes. The solid portion of the mass appeared isointensity as the muscle, the cysts showed hyperintensity just as the cerebrospinal fluid, the walls of the cysts and the septae inside the cysts showed hypointensity as the muscle tendon. Moreover, within the solid portion of the tumor, tiny septae with hypointensity were observed. These septae divided the solid portion of the tumor into small parts with different sizes. On the Gd-enhanced T1-weighted images with fat suppression (TR/TE, 500/10 ms) (Fig. –), the solid portion with septae inside and the walls and septae of the cysts displayed a remarkable enhancement, while the cystic fluid showed no enhancement. MRI also clearly showed the extension into intervertebral foramen and the invasion of the adjacent rib, just like the previous contrast-enhanced CT did.\nTo evaluate if there was any other bone involved, SPECT was carried out. The whole-body bone scan (Tc-99 m-MDP bone scintigraphy) was suggestive of a local invasion in the posterior end of the left fifth rib by the tumor, while other bones appeared normal.\nSerum calcium, phosphate, and alkaline phosphatase were within normal limits. Serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE), cytokeratin 19 fragment antigen 21-1 (CYFRA21-1), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCAg), carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), and β-human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-HCG) levels were all not elevated.\nA thoracoscopic tumor resection was performed. The mass was approximately 50 mm × 50 mm × 50 mm in size, highly vascular, focally hemorrhagic, and adherent to the aorta and the upper lobe of left lung. There was no pleural effusion, metastasis, or atelectasis. After careful separation, the tumor was completely removed, and the lesion of the involved rib was also removed. Histological examination disclosed a lot of blood-filled cavities similar to those present in aneurysmal bone cyst, and a mixture of mononuclear cells and multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells with high mitotic activity (12 figures per 10 HPFs) and no notable nuclear atypia (Fig. , ). Immunohistochemically, the tumor showed strong positive reaction in the giant cells to the histiocytic marker CD68 (Fig. ) and positive reaction in the mononuclear component to antibodies against vimentin and CD163. Ki-67 labeling index ranged from 25 to 30%, indicating nuclear positivity (Fig. ). Above all, the final pathological diagnosis was mediastinal GCT-ST of low malignant potential.\nThe patient reviewed three times after her operation. The first follow-up was 1 month after operation, when a MRI scan (Fig. ) was performed, no signs of tumor recurrence were found. Two months after the first review, the patient came for the second review with a complaint of mild dull pain on the left side of back, then a CT scan was performed (because of financial problem, she refused MRI examination), which detected a small soft tissue nodule (measuring 13 mm × 8 mm × 10 mm) right in the operative region of the posterior end of the left fifth rib (Fig. ). The patient left without any treatment after being told the situation of tumor recurrence. The third follow-up was another 2 months after the second review, which showed the recurrent tumor becoming much bigger (measuring 34 mm × 28 mm × 31 mm) (Fig. ) than found in the second review.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient's only significant past medical history was PNH, which was diagnosed two years prior to presentation in the setting of primary Budd-Chiari syndrome caused by hepatic vein thrombosis. She was also noted to be anemic at that time. The hepatic vein thrombosis was treated with a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) and anticoagulation with warfarin was initiated as secondary prevention for further thrombosis. In addition to warfarin, her other medications included eculizumab (initiated upon diagnosis of PNH), vitamin B12, and folate. The MenACWY-D conjugated vaccine was given prior to receipt of eculizumab. The vaccine against serogroup B was not yet approved for market use.\nUpon presentation to the emergency department, the patient was noted to be lethargic and hypotensive with a diffuse purpuric rash. Her initial vital signs were consistent with distributive shock: blood pressure 63/39 mmHg, heart rate 129 bpm, respiratory rate 35 bpm, and oxygen saturation 95%. Pertinent physical findings included bilateral conjunctival hemorrhages, jaundice, and diffuse purpura (Figures and ). She had a left subclavian port that was clean with no surrounding erythema, exudate, or induration. Laboratory values were notable for white blood cell count of 18.1 k/μL, platelets 67 k/μL, lactate 8.9 mmol/L, total bilirubin 21.8 mg/dL (direct 10.7 mg/dL), haptoglobin <7 mg/dL (reference range 20–135 mg/dL), and an INR of 5.18 (reference range 0.33–1.19). See . An abdominal ultrasound with Doppler revealed patent TIPS and patent hepatic vasculature including the hepatic vein.\nThe patient was immediately intubated for airway protection. Resuscitation was initiated with intravenous fluids and vasopressors. Her blood pressure remained low despite maximum doses of vasopressors. Intravenous antibiotics were administered including vancomycin, cefepime, and ampicillin. Hydrocortisone was administered as adjunctive therapy in the setting of sepsis and concern for Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome. She was admitted to the intensive care unit for further management. There her hemodynamics stabilized twenty-four hours after her initial presentation. Blood cultures grew Gram-negative diplococci identified as Neisseria meningitidis. The bacterial isolate was sent to the state health department laboratory for serogrouping and was determined to be nongroupable. Upon confirming Neisseria meningitidis infection, a contact investigation was launched by the hospital epidemiology team to identify those requiring meningococcal prophylaxis.\nAfter Neisseria meningitidis was identified, the antibiotics were narrowed to ceftriaxone 2 grams every 12 hours and then later switched to cefotaxime 2 grams every 6 hours to avoid potential hepatic toxicity. High dose steroids were carefully tapered off and the patient displayed no signs of Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome. Eculizumab dosing was continued at her normal dosing interval. Intravenous antibiotics were continued for a total of 14 days, after which she began taking penicillin-VK 250 mg orally twice daily to be continued indefinitely for Neisseria meningitidis prophylaxis. Once available, she also received the vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B. She will require a booster of the conjugated MenACWY vaccine every 5 years. She was given a prescription for oral ciprofloxacin at a dose of 750 mg to have on hand for “rescue therapy” if symptoms of meningococcal infection recur, with strict recommendations to also seek immediate medical attention in this circumstance. Fortunately, the patient has done very well since this life-threatening event with no further infectious issues. Her TIPS continues to function well and she has normal liver function. She continues to have evidence of mild hemolysis (slightly elevated bilirubin and LDH) on eculizumab but overall her symptoms are controlled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient presented 172 cm height, 62 kg weight, and female appearance. She had normal female genitalia with visible vaginal orifice, urethral orifice, and a normal size clitoris, but scanty pubic and axillary hairs (Tanner stage II). The breast developed automatically since the age of 12 and physical examination showed developed breasts of Tanner stage III. No family member had similar symptoms. Her medical history included bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and chemotherapy because of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) when she was 12 years old. So far there is no sign of AML recurrence.\nLaboratory examination showed a 46 XY karyotype, elevated follicle stimulating hormone (FSH 18.0 mIU/mL, reference range < 10 mIU/mL), low estrogen (E2 27.53 pg/mL, reference range 27.0–122.0 pg/mL), and normal luteinizing hormone (LH 6.9 mIU/mL, reference range 2.12–10.89 mIU/mL), prolactin (PRL 15.35 ng/mL, reference range < 30 ng/mL), testosterone (T 0.13 ng/mL, reference range 0.10–0.75 ng/mL), progesterone (P 0.25 ng/mL, reference range 0.38–29.26 ng/mL), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S 3.96 μmol/L, reference range 1.77–9.99 μmol/L). The levels of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, renin activity (PRA), aldosterone (ALD), 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17-α-OHP), serum potassium level, and blood pressure were all in normal range. Perineal and pelvic ultrasound scans showed underdeveloped uterus and vagina, no ovary found in the pelvis, and no testis detected in the pelvis, inguinal and perineal region. Bone age was not evaluated in the patient.\nFemale appearance individuals with primary amenorrhea and 46 XY karyotype would be considered DSD. Typical DSD diseases include 46 XY, pure gonadal dysgenesis (46XY PGD), androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) and 46 XY 17 alpha-hydroxylase/17, 20-lyase deficiency (17OHD). 46XY PGD patients presented obvious elevated FSH (usually >40 mIU/mL) with low E2 and T; they had small uterus, streak gonads, and infantile female genitalia, while no automatic breast development and pubic hair. Complete AIS patients presented normal female genitalia and automatic breast development with normal FSH level and significantly elevated T and slightly lower E2 compared with normal adult woman. They had well-developed testes either located in pelvis, inguinal canal, or labium major. The 46XY 17OHD patients presented obvious elevated FSH and P, low T, and E2. Complete 17OHD patients usually had primary amenorrhea without female second sex characteristics, hypertension, and hypokalemia as a result of lower synthesis of T and E2, elevated ACTH, and mineral corticosterone; they had underdeveloped gonad, female genitalia, and no uterus. However, in this patient, she already presented some female pubertal characteristics. Her mildly elevated FSH, low E2, P and T, normal ACTH, PRA, ALD and 17-α-OHP, normal blood pressure and serum potassium level, underdeveloped uterus and no testes in the pelvis, inguinal and perineal region were not identical with Y-chromosome-related DSD diseases.\nWith the doubts, we noticed her BMT medical history and check the whole medical record carefully. In 2009, she was diagnosed AML-M5 and received the HLA-matched bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell from her brother. Before BMT, she had bone marrow aspiration (BMA) and bone marrow chromosome karyotype was 46, XX, t(2; 12)(p23; q12), t(11; 22)(q23; q11) (normal female karyotype with translocation of chromosome 2 and 12 and of 11 and 22, usually no significant negative effect on growth and development of carriers). However, 37 days after BMT, her bone marrow presented that 96.57% of cells were donor derived and peripheral blood test showed 95.87% donor derived. The bone marrow chromosome karyotype was changed to 46 XY (normal male karyotype). After that, she had infusion of donor NK cells for 3 times. Also, 7 months after BMT, her bone marrow presented 100% donor derived. Additionally, as adjuvant therapy for AML, she also received DAE (Ida+AraC+VP-16), improved Bu/Cy (AraC+busulfan+CTX+VM-26+MeCCNU), MTX+MD-AraC, CAG (AraC+ACR+G-CSF), and HAG (AraC+HHT+G-CSF) intravenous chemotherapy. The chemotherapy contained busulfan and cyclophosphamide (CTX), which had been proved highly toxic to ovary and probably caused primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) for her.\nThe changed karyotype after BMT well explained why the patient's clinical features were not consistent with the typical 46 XY karyotype DSD. The patient was normal female with normal chromosome karyotype before BMT and a primary amenorrhea. The reason of primary amenorrhea could be ovarian hypofunction associated with BMT and chemotherapy.\nDuring the second visit, the patient had her menarche lasting 4 days without any medication. However, she had no period in the next 2 months. The rechecked sex hormone levels presented a significant change (LH: 30.3 mIU/mL, FSH: 73.25 mIU/mL, E2: 23.15 pg/mL). The markedly elevated FSH and lower E2 suggested poor ovarian function. We will keep following up and probably prescribed hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for her.\nThe case report was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Informed consent was given by the patient.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She also had blurring of vision associated with fever and headache for 15 days. The patient complained of pain in the anal region while passing stools for the last one week.\nOn examination, she was severely pale with an initial pulse rate of 100/min and a blood pressure of 100/70mm Hg. On local examination, she was found to have anal fissures.\nOn investigating, her peripheral smear revealed pancytopenia with a haemoglobin of 4 g%, total leucocyte count of 490/cu mm and a platelet count of 13000/cu mm. Her bone marrow biopsy was diagnostic of aplastic anaemia. An ophthalmological examination by fundoscopy and a B-scan ultrasonography (USG) was done and she was found to have bilateral vitreous haemorrhage and retinopathy.\nShe was transfused with multiple units of packed red cells and platelets. She was started on medroxy-progesterone acetate and tranexamic acid for menorrhagia along with iron and folate tablets. She was given cyclosporine for aplastic anaemia. In view of high fever spikes of 103 to 104 degrees F, she was started on empirical ceftazidime and amikacin. Her fever could not be localised and her initial blood and urine cultures were sterile. She had persistent fever and was switched over to meropenam and then to vancomycin.\nAfter one week her perianal pain worsened and she passed blood clots per rectum associated with pus discharge. Her anal canal was extremely tender. Computed tomography (CT) scan of her abdomen and pelvis showed features suggestive of perianal abscess with proctitis and sloughed out mucosa in the anal canal (Figure ).\nOn examination under anaesthesia, the following findings were noted: the entire anal canal from the anal verge to about 10 cm proximal appeared dark brown in colour with sloughed out mucosa, the sphincters appeared non-viable, the tone was lost, and there was no bleeding on cutting through the tissues. The anal canal was filled with foul-smelling necrotic tissues mixed with blood clots (Figure ).\nDebridement of the necrotic devitalised tissues was done and the pus collection was drained (Figure ). A diversion transverse colostomy was made. She was started on piperacillin-tazobactam and clindamycin.\nGram stain of necrotic tissues revealed gram-positive bacilli suggestive of Clostridium along with budding yeast cells. Her subsequent blood cultures grew Clostridium spp and then Escherichia coli (intermediate sensitivity to imipenam) and Acinetobacter baumanii (resistant to all). Her total leucocyte count dropped down to 270/cu mm with an absolute neutrophil count of 30/cu mm. Her general condition worsened. She developed acidosis with the deterioration of vitals. She was resuscitated and was given mechanical ventilation.

She is a right-handed artist and of a potentially left-hemispheric cerebral dominance. She has a past history of substance use and misuse starting at the age of eleven years, smoking cannabis and hashish; at that age she developed an abnormally and continuously dilated pupil () leaving a thin rim of blue iridial tissue; the condition is affecting both eyes (bilaterally) though both pupils still react to light, including sunlight (i.e., pupillary light reflex is intact).\nShe had no complaints except for intolerance to sunlight, both direct and indirect, which mandates wearing UV sunglasses for optimal protection of the retina as advised by a specialist optometrist. Hence, the patient is almost unbothered by her condition; she described it by saying “my eyes always look like this, I have constantly dilated pupils, haha, not even tripping.” In fact, she considers her overall eye appearance as sexier than the normal eye. However, she was bothered of the potential eye and retinal damage from overexposure to sunlight.\nThe patient has correlated her eye condition with the use of hallucinogens, primarily with LSD (acid) and psilocybin mushrooms. Furthermore, her condition started at the age of eleven years in association with substance use. Hence, it is not congenital. In 1992, the 1st case of a bilateral congenital mydriasis was reported in the literature []. The patient has a past medical history, being treated with citalopram and Ritalin for the management of her chronic endogenous depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); she has been on these medications for several years. She also admitted using tramadol, opium, and opioid derivatives; these substances induce a paradoxical effect on her pupil leading to pupillary constriction. The patient had no prior history of head trauma, brain tumors, or any other neurological conditions. Furthermore, a thorough neurological and radiological exam was done; an MRI of the head and neck region was also entirely normal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient reported that she had waxing and waning low back pain ever since her bicycle collision four months prior, but for the last six weeks, it had insidiously increased to an unbearable intensity. On presentation, she described her pain as a dull, throbbing pain lasting all day, which was localized to the lower back region without radiation elsewhere. She rated her pain as “10/10” and noted that it worsened with prolonged immobility; however, the pain was not exacerbated by movement. She was previously treated with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, hydrocodone, and tramadol with little effect. The patient did not have any recent sick contacts or travels, and she did not believe her pain was related to her bicycle accident. She denied fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, bladder and bowel incontinence, weakness, numbness, and saddle anesthesia. Except for obesity and her previously mentioned bicycle accident, her medical history was otherwise unremarkable. The patient was evaluated in the emergency department (ED) at the time of her accident and reported that she sustained no fractures or significant soft tissue injury. She had no prior surgeries, and her family history was also unremarkable. She was a student at a local community college and lived at home with her parents, boyfriend, and 16-month old son. The patient denied smoking or illicit drug use, but she endorsed the occasional alcohol use.\nOn presentation, her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure; 124/76 mmHg, heart rate; 84, respiratory rate; 16, temperature (oral), 36.6°C, and oxygen saturation (room air), 97%. Her body mass index (BMI) was 38.0. On physical examination, she was obese, alert and oriented, and in obvious pain. She had no gait abnormalities. There were no visible lesions, rashes, ulcers, or ecchymosis throughout her body, and there was no visible evidence of scoliosis, kyphosis, or lordosis. There was midline point tenderness along the spine in the L4-L5 region without significant para spinal muscle tenderness. No pulsatile masses were appreciated on the abdominal exam, and there was no costovertebral angle tenderness. The patient was completely neurovascularly intact and had full strength in all major muscle groups throughout her bilateral upper and lower extremities. All deep tendon reflexes were 2+ and symmetric, and the Babinski reflex was absent bilaterally. Forward flexion and extension of the spine were limited due to pain, but there was a full, active range of motion with lateral flexion. Straight leg raise was negative bilaterally. The remainder of her physical exam was unremarkable.\nA complete blood count with differential showed no leukocytosis or other abnormalities. Because of point tenderness along the patient’s lower lumbar spine, lumbar radiographs were obtained. These radiographs showed normal bone density, normal alignment, and curvature of the spine, no evidence of acute fractures and overall no significant degenerative changes. However, there was a small Schmorl’s node noted in the inferior endplate of L5 best seen on the lateral lumbar view (Figure ). The anteroposterior (AP) view showed unremarkable findings (Figure ). Given the history of previous trauma, lower lumbar point tenderness on physical exam and radiographic findings consistent with an SNs, the patient was diagnosed with low back pain secondary to a trauma-induced SNs. The patient was then referred to an orthopedic spine surgeon who recommended physical therapy, weight loss, ice packs, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as initial management. She was informed that surgical treatment existed if her symptoms persisted despite conservative management. The patient agreed with conservative management, and her pain improved over the next several months.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient reported that this was the third episode of hematemesis in one day. She was managed in ER for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) with fluid support and urgent transamine injections. Her blood pressure was 100/60mm Hg and pulse were 100 per minute. After stabilization, she was transferred to the inpatient ward for further investigation and management.\nOn examination, the patient was in acute distress due to her recurrent bleeding episode. She had elicited tenderness on palpation in right upper quadrant (RUQ) and left lower quadrant (LLQ) of her abdomen. Rest of the physical examination is unremarkable. Her weight was 45kg and height was 162.5cm. She had never been to school and her education took place at home by her family.\nPreviously, she had severe headaches with 8/10 in intensity for three months. She had a computerized tomography (CT) scan done two months ago for her headache in a different hospital where she was admitted due to her complaints of a headache and blurry vision. She further claimed that CT scan showed the blood clot in her head and she was taking a blood thinner (unknown anti-platelet agent) for it. The patient was unable to present the reports when a physician asked for it. She took a blood thinner which was available over the counter (OTC).\nAccording to her, she had first episode of bleeding from the ear when she was two years old. She never had any bleeding episode afterward. She had menarche at an age of thirteen years and she had regular menstruation and reported the use of one pad per day for four days every month. For last three months, she had menometrorrhagia and she also had watery discharge along with it. Complete work up for bleeding disorders (bleeding time, prothrombin time, quantiative analysis of platelets) and serology (autoimmune disorders) ordered came back normal.\nLater, the patient also mentioned about seizure episodes associated with her menses. She told that she had three to four episodes of generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures, each lasting for 10-15 minutes. Her last event of seizures was in the emergency department. The event was not witnessed by anyone (physicians, nursing staff or family member). She experienced a severe postictal headache in the frontal region.\nShe got symptomatic relief in a headache with acetaminophen. Upon admission, baseline labs were ordered including complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), liver function test (LFT), complete bleeding profile, antinuclear antibody (ANA), electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), chest X-ray (CXR), stool detailed report and urine detailed report was ordered. All her tests came back normal.\nShe again had an episode of upper gastrointestinal bleeding on the third day of admission. This time patient had fresh blood on her shirt. This event was concerning for the possibility of a qualitative platelet defect or a rare collagen disorder. She underwent qualitative analysis which did not show abnormalities on Adenosine 5’- diphosphate (ADP) and collagen test. The patient was evaluated by a gastroenterologist and had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which showed mild gastritis. In addition, a viral panel (Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C) and a CT scan of the abdomen and the chest were non-suggestive of any pathology.\nThe patient was given omeprazole oral tablets twice a day and was managed symptomatically. Next day she had blood in tears as shown in figure #1 which was an alarming symptom and raised the concern of haemolacria secondary to ophthalmological disorder. Ophthalmology consult was made and after ruling out every serious possibility like trauma, tumors, etc., she was put under close surveillance for haemolacria episode. On the same night, she bled again from eyes with each layer of bloody tears coming from eyes. She also mentioned blood oozing from nipples and vagina. Repeat physical examination was done and a bottle was found beneath her bed which she refused to give initially and kept insisting that the bottle has medications. Upon opening the bottle, a nurse found blood in it which she said she collected from her nipples. There was no mark of any fresh or dried blood on a body orifice and her breast examination was also satisfactory.\nOn her sixth day of admission, the patient complained of continuous chest pain and she said she had it for three to four times per week since last three years. She added that she forgot to address it on the day of admission. Chest pain was sharp in quality and diffuse in nature. ECG had no acute changes. When asked about any previous episodes of chest pain, she told that she had an episode before and that always relieved by getting some fresh air.\nOn the eighth day of admission, the patient complained about dribbling of urine since eight months. According to her, she used to take bath five times in a day. But on examination, she had not changed her clothes since admission. On observation, she was in acute distress and in severe need of any kind of management. Patient demanded medical or surgical treatment to relieve her different symptoms. She was from the low socioeconomic group and family was concerned about her illness and prompt treatment. They had incurred a huge financial loss for last eight months in seeking medical opinions about her various conditions. She was given different treatments but none of them ever helped.\nSuch plausible and fabricated medical history raised our concern for a psychiatric consult. After having a long session individually with the patient alone and then with her relatives revealed the fact that she was the only female in her family and therefore; the center of attention and care. Our psychiatrist advised close camera surveillance and vigilant observation of the patient after getting consent from the family. It was found patient used that bottle of blood as a source for her tears. They counseled family members about her symptoms in detail and advised to keep her occupied in different activities with paying less attention to her complaints. A conclusive diagnosis of Munchausen syndrome was made after a detailed assessment. We discharged her after one week and followed-up with serial cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) sessions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No extremity edema was noted, and no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy was present.\nOn laboratory evaluation, lactate dehydrogenase was markedly elevated (847 U/L) (nL 140–250 U/L) with uric acid (16.3 mg/dL) (nL 3–5.8 mg/dL). CA 125 level was found to be 637 U/mL (nL < 35). Additional labs were within normal limits including CBC/diff, BMP, and LFTs.\nCT abdomen and US of abdomen performed one month priorly for similar complaints were without abnormalities. On repeat imaging during admission, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was significant for extensive thickening, nodularity, and enhancement of the peritoneum and omentum, read as consistent with carcinomatosis (Figures –). Additional findings included multiple bilobar attenuation hepatic lesions, pelvic and pericardial adenopathy, and moderate size bilateral pleural effusions. PET/CT was significant for hypermetabolic activity throughout peritoneal cavity with omental caking (Figures -). Hypermetabolic liver lesions were noted with retrosternal and bilateral iliac chain nodes also suspicious for malignancy.\nPeritoneal fluid cytology was consistent with CD10+ B cell population.

On clinical inspection, the tooth had a class I composite filling without marginal discoloration. A lucency of enamel was obvious beneath the mesial marginal ridge. A diagnostic parallel image showed a mesial carious lesion in the second molar and with careful inspection the palatal root was not well-defined which was justifiable due to the superimposition of the zygomatic arch (). According to the patient, she had been tolerating extreme tooth hyper-sensitivity lately and it led to severe nocturnal pain during the last two nights; upon cold testing with Endo-Ice frozen gas (Coltene/Whaledent, Inc., Mahwah, NJ, USA) severe discomfort was reported by the patient.

Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 144 mm in first hour with a C-reactive protein of 60 mg/L. Her renal functions were within range with no protein or cells in urine. Her transaminases were within the normal limits. She had marginally low serum albumin of 35 g/L. A chest radiograph and X-ray of hers hands were unremarkable.\nShe was empirically started on a broad-spectrum antibiotic after septic screen including urine and blood cultures which were negative subsequently. However, the fact that she had persistent fever spikes warranted further investigations. An ultrasound of her neck confirmed lymphadenopathy and lymph node architecture was preserved. There was no ultrasonic evidence of organomegaly or para-aortic lymphadenopathy. A two-dimensional echocardiogram was normal. Her LDH level was 1254 u/L. Serum ferritin was > 1200 mg/mL. Anti-nuclear factor (ANA) and rheumatoid factor were negative. A peripheral smear for malarial parasite was negative. A Mantoux test was negative.\nTwo provisional diagnoses were made: considering fever with B symptoms, lymphadenopathy, and high LDH, a provisional diagnosis of lymphoma was made; and considering her fever, elevated blood counts (major criteria), lymphadenopathy (minor criteria) along with an elevated ferritin level, a provisional diagnosis of AOSD was made.\nA cervical lymph node biopsy revealed partially effaced architecture and areas of necrosis, infiltrated with nuclear dust; surrounding tissue shows mononuclear cells (Fig. ). Histopathological findings were compatible with necrotizing lymphadenitis more in keeping with Kikuchi’s lymphadenitis. Prior to starting steroids she underwent a bone biopsy and subsequently it was found to be a normal marrow.\nShe was started on orally administered prednisolone 30 mg daily. She was fever free 24 hours after starting steroids and had a marked sense of clinical wellbeing. Currently she is followed up in the medical clinic. At 1 month her ESR had come down to 40 mm in first hour and she was asymptomatic with reduction in the size of cervical lymph nodes. Now she is on tapering off doses of prednisolone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She had experienced previous mood lability and attentional impairments as a teenager and had been treated for both during that time. However, she had been off medications for 5 years and had been doing well in the recent past. Grades and athletic functioning were above average, and she played three sports in high school and was in mainstream classes. Her family history was notable for a history of maternal depression, psychogenic nonepileptic seizures, and anxiety, as well as a maternal grandmother with a reported history of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Eight months prior to the patient's referral to neurology, she experienced a self-limited illness characterized by diarrhea, headache, and vomiting. This was managed at home, although she was seen by her primary care provider and diagnosed with a viral gastroenteritis. Approximately one month later, she began to experience insomnia, mood lability, and weight loss. Memory issues ensued, and the parents reported that she began to frequently lose objects and had difficulty remembering bus routes. Personal hygiene suffered, and after 4 months of worsening symptoms, she began to experience weekly episodes of urinary incontinence. There were no other autonomic manifestations. Throughout the course of the subacute illness, she experienced a “tremor” of the left upper extremity when attempting to manipulate or reach for objects, as well as dragging her left foot when ambulating. She received ongoing psychiatric treatment and monitoring, and her movement phenomenon was attributed to a psychogenic cause, and a diagnosis of likely schizoaffective disorder was made. After 7 months of symptoms, she experienced a spell, characterized by clonic movements of the left hand, followed by tonic stiffening of her entire body, with right sided head and neck deviation, lasting 30 seconds, followed by confusion and sedation. She recovered to baseline after 30 minutes. After this episode, she was referred to neurology. On initial presentation to our service, her spell was attributed to a first-time seizure by history. Mental status examination demonstrated a distracted and labile demeanor. Cognition was impaired on both bedside and formal neuropsychological testing with impairments in memory, attention, and reasoning. Neurologic examination demonstrated left sided dysmetria as well as gait disturbance arising from left lower extremity coordination impairment. MRI of the brain revealed increased FLAIR signal of the left hippocampus. No cerebellar or contralateral brain findings were identified as potential substrate for her unilateral ataxia. Electroencephalogram was normal. The combination of her ataxia, cognitive decline, and incontinence prompted an extensive laboratory evaluation for systemic conditions as well as inborn errors of metabolism. Spinal tap was performed, with testing for autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. Testing was positive only for the presence of NMDA receptor antibodies in the spinal fluid (NMDA-R Ab IF Titer Assay, CSF Positive 1 : 4 and reference < 1 : 2, Mayo Clinic Laboratories) with no evidence of active infection or inflammation. Extensive evaluation for a neoplastic substrate, specifically ovarian teratoma, was negative. Because of the extended course experienced by the patient she was started on an aggressive regimen of immune modulation, including concurrent intravenous immunoglobulin, IV methylprednisolone, and rituximab. Although her parents report that psychiatric symptoms were improving after 3 months of treatment, she continues to require medical treatment for her psychiatric manifestations and has been unable to return to school or employment. Additionally, her movement abnormalities persist.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She had no significant medical history. Patient denied consuming alcohol, smoking, consuming tobacco or any drug usage, oral contraceptive pill. Her menstrual history was normal. She was negative for any history of hepatitis, bleeding or clotting disorders. Physical examination reveals mild tender hepatosplenomegaly. She was not icteric. Rectal examination was negative for gross blood. Laboratory findings revealed normal blood counts and transaminase activity. Stool also tested negative for occult blood. An abdominal ultrasound demonstrated mild hepatomegaly with normal echo-texture, mild splenomegaly and the presence of a dilated and obstructed portal vein (). This finding was further confirmed with a computed tomography (CT) scan, which showed an enlarged portal vein (20 mm), with multiple linear filling defects extending into the main portal vein and both the branches with necrosis of segment III of the left lobe of liver (). The scan further described thrombosis into the superior mesenteric vein as well. In light of the finding of PVT, the patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which revealed four columns of grade III nonbleeding esophageal varices in the distal esophagus along with fundal gastropathy (esophagogastric varices, type 1) (). Variceal band ligation (VBL) was performed as primary prophylaxis. With an unknown etiology for portal vein thrombosis (PVT), additional laboratory serum studies were performed to search for hypercoagulable disorders as well as evidence of intrinsic hepatic disease. Serum homo-cysteine levels were elevated to 36.94 mmol/l and protein S activity was slightly decreased at 54%. A liver biopsy showed no evidence of cirrhosis ().

She reported that she had not had sexual intercourse within the previous 6 months. Based on physical findings, including fever and presence of swollen tonsils with white pus-filled spots, as well as laboratory findings that revealed liver dysfunction (AST: 373 IU/L, ALT: 461 IU/L) and inflammatory status (white blood cell count: 18600 μ/L, CRP: 5.4 mg/dL), a diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis was made. She was hospitalized, and treatment with 200 mg/day of minocycline and 300 mg/day of hydrocortisone was started. The next day, she exhibited symptoms of right abdominal pain, and computed tomography (CT) scan revealed ascites. The diagnosis of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis Syndrome was suspected, and treatment of 2 g/day of azithromycin was initiated. However, she presented with worsening of liver function. Drug-induced liver injury was suspected, and all antibiotics were discontinued. After withdrawal of the drugs, she presented with coagulopathy and further worsening of liver function tests, wherein she was transferred to our hospital.\nOn admission to our hospital, the patient's mental status was Glasgow coma scale (GCS) 13 (eye opening: 3; verbal response: 4; best motor response: 6), hepatic encephalopathy grade 2, and her body temperature was 38.1°C. Other vital signs were stable as follows: blood pressure 114/67 mmHg, heart rate 88 bpm, SpO2 99% in room air, and respiratory rate 17/min. No skin abnormalities were identified. A laboratory analysis revealed severe liver dysfunction, coagulopathy, inflammation, thrombocytopenia, and anemia ().\nAn abdominal and chest dynamic contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed periportal collar sign, splenomegaly, and a small amount of ascites and pleural effusion (). No obvious hepatic atrophy was observed. The patient was diagnosed with ALF based on criteria published by the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare of Japan [, ], although the etiology was unknown (drug-induced ALF was suspected). The patient was treated six times with hemodialysis filtration (HDF) and four times with peritoneal dialysis (). Although the origin of the fever was not determined, infectious disease was suspected, and the patient was treated with antibiotics as shown in . Liver needle biopsy was performed on day 29. Histopathological findings showed piecemeal necrosis and nuclear inclusion bodies (). Neither extensive necrosis nor obvious parenchymal hepatocytes or liver fibrosis was observed. The pathological diagnosis of a fragment of liver tissue indicated periportal hepatocellular loss and regenerative bile duct (). Focal necrosis accompanied by lymphocyte infiltration and eosinophilic body is scarcely recognized in the hepatocytes in the lobule. Some of the hepatocytes around the Gleason sheath are accompanied by piecemeal necrosis and show extensive shedding, but the reconstructed image is poor. The appearance of multinucleated hepatocytes is observed at another site in the leaflet. The Gleason sheath is fibrillary in part with mild infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells and mild neutrophil infiltration. Aggregation of regenerated bile ducts was observed. No cholestasis was apparent in hepatocytes or bile ducts. These findings appear to be consistent with acute liver injury.\nThe patient recovered from ALF and was discharged from the hospital on day 30.\nIn order to reveal the cause of her liver failure, we retrospectively screened her stored blood samples by RNA sequencing for the presence of viral RNA. The patient provided written informed consent, and the study was performed in accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki and with the approval of the local ethics committee. RNA-Seq, also called whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing, involves isolation of sample RNA, depletion of ribosomal RNA, and synthesis of cDNA, which is then sequenced using next generation sequencing technology. RNA was extracted from stored blood samples, and fragmented RNA was linked with RNA 3′ adapter. Reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction were performed using single-stranded cDNA templates. Sequencing was performed using the HiSEQ 2500 platform (Illumina, Tokyo, Japan) using paired end reads. Reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic (version 0.36), and quality scores were examined before and after trimming using FastQC (version 0.11.3). Bowtie2 [] was used to map the RNA reads against 7,195 sequences from the viral RefSeq collection downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (downloaded on April 17, 2016). All sequence analysis was performed on the Shirokane 3 supercomputer at the University of Tokyo.\nResults of Bowtie2 mapping revealed matches against three viral RefSeq sequences: NC_022518.1 (human endogenous retrovirus K113: 164 reads), NC_023677.1 (chimpanzee alpha-1 herpesvirus strain 105650: 264 reads), and NC_001798.2 (human herpesvirus 2 strain HG52: 270,696 reads). After remapping, 1,216,468 out of a total of 139,632,418 reads (0.87%) mapped to the NC_001798.2 human herpesvirus 2 reference genome, overlapping 80% of the 154,657 nt reference sequence with an average coverage depth of 768 and a maximum coverage depth of 6,991 ().\nBased on the results of read mapping, real-time PCR was used to retrospectively quantify relative HSV-DNA levels in stored blood samples. DNA was extracted from 100 μL of serum (day 1 and day 2) and plasma (day 28) using SMI-TEST (Genome Science Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions and dissolved in 20 μL of distilled water. Real-time PCR analysis was performed using the Mx300P System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. We prepared 10 μL of Brilliant III Ultra-Fast SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix with Low ROX (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), 100 nM of forward primer: TCAGCCCATCCTCCTTCGGCAGTA (target: Glycoprotein G, Nucleotide position: 138240–138262; derived from GenBank accession number Z86099), 100 nM of reverse primer: CGCGCGGTCCCAGATCGGCA (target: Glycoprotein G, Nucleotide position: 138398–138380), 2 μL of DNA, and 7.6 μL of distilled water. The cycling program was as follows: the sample was heated for 3 minutes at 95°C for denaturing, followed by a PCR cycling program consisting of 40 two-step cycles of 5 seconds at 95°C and 20 seconds at 60°C. RT-PCR analysis confirmed the presence of HSV-DNA in the patient's blood samples at the time of admission and revealed that HSV-DNA levels had decreased by a factor of 10−6 between days 1 and 28 (), shortly after which the patient was discharged. Acute HSV infection in this patient was also confirmed by a positive test for HSV-IgM antibody (8.6: normal range, <0.8) measured using stored serum samples.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A computed tomography (CT) scan of her chest revealed a pericardial effusion which was negative for malignancy. The presumptive diagnosis was viral pericarditis. In February 2016, she developed recurrent left-sided chest pain and was found to have cardiac tamponade. An enhancing mass was identified in the right atrium on imaging (Figure ). She underwent a pericardial window procedure which revealed a vascular tumor invading the pericardium. The frozen section of the specimen was consistent with sarcoma. In March 2016, she underwent pericardiectomy with biopsy of the tumor revealing angiosarcoma of the right atrium. After the procedure, she was started on a neoadjuvant cycle of doxorubicin (25 mg/m2, one to three days) and ifosfamide (1.8 g/m2, one to five days). She was then treated with four other cycles of doxorubicin and ifosfamide followed by four cycles of paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 weekly for three of four weeks. Follow up imaging revealed an increase in the tumor size with interval development of small volume metastasis to the right lung. In November 2016, she underwent the surgical resection of the right atrial tumor after she was found to have metastatic lung nodules. The pathology showed angiosarcoma with the treatment effect and evidence of invasion of the cardiac muscle and fibrous connective tissue. New pulmonary nodules were evident on subsequent imaging which led to further chemotherapy treatment. She initially received a cycle of gemcitabine 900 mg/m2 followed by four cycles of gemcitabine 1500 mg/m2 and dacarbazine 500 mg/m2. A week prior to receiving her fifth cycle, she developed severe chest tightness and was found to have left-sided pneumothorax requiring surgical management with left-sided video-assisted thoracoscopic bullectomy.

The bone marrow specimen consisted of more than 70% myelomonoblast (M4), which was positive for MPO, CD13, CD14, and CD33 in flow cytometry study, and also she had normal cytogenetics. She underwent induction chemotherapy with 3 + 7 regimen daunorubicin + ara C and achieved complete remission, after that she took intensification chemotherapy for 3 cycles.

The mother had routine prenatal care and there were no significant exposures. Pregnancy was complicated by pyelectasis and absent cavum septum pellucidum detected on ultrasound during the second trimester fetal anatomy survey. Upon transfer of care at 35 weeks (after the family relocated), she was started on weekly non-stress tests due to the presence of suspected fetal anomalies. A repeat ultrasound obtained at 39 3/7 weeks GA showed accelerated fetal growth (gestational age equivalents: biparietal diameter: 40 0/7 weeks, head circumference 40 6/7 weeks, abdominal circumference 39 6/7 weeks, femur length 37 1/7 weeks), and apparent fusion of the anterior lateral ventricles, concerning for alobar holoprosencephaly. The infant was delivered by cesarean section after a failed induction of labor with Apgars of 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 min, respectively. The infant was large for gestational age with a birth weight of 4,165 g (96th percentile, z-score 1.88), length of 53.3 cm (98th percentile, z-score 2.23), and occipitofrontal head circumference of 38.5 cm (∼100th percentile, z-score 3.90) (WHO 0–2 years female growth chart).\nThe proband was noted to have multiple dysmorphic features at birth (Figure ). She had macrocephaly, fusion of the left coronal suture, facial asymmetry with a hypoplastic left supra-orbital ridge and contralateral frontal bossing, and flat occiput. The nasal bridge was depressed with short, anteverted nares and the bulbous nasal tip deviated to the right. The right ear was smaller than the left with an irregular contour and redundant tissue. Ocular anomalies included hypertelorism with irregular contour of the eyelids, microphthalmia, and inability to open the right eye spontaneously. Ectopic eyelashes were noted on the upper eyelid. Dilated fundoscopic exam revealed sectoral (partial) clouding of both corneas, right greater than left. The palate was intact and the mandible was normal. There was pre-axial polydactyly with bilateral partial duplication of the thumbs and great toes. A single transverse palmar crease was present on the right hand. Examination of the skin revealed thickened, marbled areas normally pigmented and hypopigmented skin on the right trunk, and bilaterally on the lower extremities (see right shoulder in Figure a and lower extremities in Figure c). The skin had an atrophic, pebbly texture with patches of abnormal hair on the extremities. The abdomen was distended but soft without palpable masses or organomegaly. The remainder of the examination including respiratory, cardiovascular, genitourinary, and neurologic systems was unremarkable. Upon recognition, the distinctive pattern of cutaneous findings, craniosynostosis, and pre-axial polysyndactyly by an examiner (MCJ) with previous experience with CJS, a clinical diagnosis of CJS was made in the proband.\nRenal ultrasound revealed mild bilateral hydronephrosis and cranial ultrasound suggested callosal agenesis. Subsequent brain MRI revealed near-complete agenesis of the corpus callosum. Radiographs of the upper extremities showed pre-axial polydactyly with osseus syndactyly of the extra digit to the thumb and a short first metacarpal on the right hand; the left hand also had pre-axial polysyndactyly. Radiographs of the lower extremities showed bilateral pre-axial polydactyly. CT scan of the head showed left coronal craniosynostosis as well as multiple intrasutural bones being noted, similar to wormian bones. A SNP-oligonucleotide microarray showed 46, XX without pathogenic copy number variation.\nOn the fourth day of life, the patient was evaluated for decreased oral intake followed by 1 day of bilious emesis and abdominal distention. Upright abdominal radiographs revealed significant proximal bowel dilatation. She was decompressed with oral-gastric (OG) suction and bowel rest with initial improvement in symptoms. However, she continued to have bilious OG output in the absence of bowel movements for multiple days. Serial abdominal radiographs did not show obvious obstruction, although she had very delayed transit of contrast through her bowel and rectum. Rectal biopsies were obtained which revealed the presence of ganglion cells, effectively ruling out Hirschsprung disease. Rare hypertrophic nerve bundles were also noted on biopsy. After rectal biopsy, an upper GI radiographic series with barium contrast revealed malrotation without volvulus and delayed emptying of contrast through the cecum and rectum.\nOn day 14, the infant underwent exploratory laparotomy and Ladd procedure to address the malrotation. During laparotomy, the patient was found to have a curvature at the duodenum that appeared almost twisted but no Ladd bands crossing the small bowel, and no obvious point of obstruction. Throughout the abdomen on the mesentery and the surface of the bowel and appendix were small tumors (Figure a). Formalin-fixed biopsies of these tumors revealed smooth muscle bundles with intermyenteric ganglion cell nests (Figure ), a distinctive feature that provided further confirmation of the diagnosis of CJS. Additionally, the patient had a blind-ended tubular structure that appeared to originate from behind the pancreas with increasing diameter (1.5 cm) as it descended posteriorly, consistent in appearance with a congenital intestinal duplication (Figure b). The postoperative course was complicated by prolonged ileus and required parental nutrition until the 27th day of life. The infant was discharged home on full oral feeding after 45 hospital days.\nFollowing NICU discharge, the infant had intermittent emesis, poor weight gain on 24 kcal fortified formula, and chronic constipation. She was admitted at 5 months of age for failure to thrive. The infant was noted to have a focal area of esophageal narrowing just below the level of the thoracic inlet on a modified barium swallow study. An upper GI and small bowel series with barium contrast demonstrated diffuse intestinal distension. Anorectal manometry revealed borderline elevated resting pressure of the internal anal sphincter with normal recto-ano inhibitory reflex. The esophageal pH study was normal. A follow-up brain MRI demonstrated left cerebellar tonsillar ectopia, near complete agenesis of the corpus callosum, colpocephaly, increased size of the lateral and third ventricles, and a dysgenesis of the tectal plate and delayed myelination for age. The infant underwent gastrostomy tube placement for dysmotility and poor weight gain. Intraoperative findings included a markedly dilated transverse colon. The infant was discharged home on continuous gastrostomy tube feedings after 45 hospital days.\nThe infant was readmitted when she was 8 months old for feeding intolerance and weight loss. Upon admission, this formerly macrosomic infant had a weight for age less than the first percentile (z = −3.32), length was less than the first percentile (z = −2.35), and head circumference at the 73rd percentile (z = 0.63) on WHO growth charts. She developed intermittent abdominal distension, emesis, and irritability when gastrostomy feedings were advanced. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated diffuse colon dilatation without obvious mechanical obstruction. The abdominal distension improved with placement of a nasogastric tube. Based on the imaging findings, the diagnosis of CJS, and known anatomical abnormalities from prior procedures, the clinical picture was most likely to be caused by colonic pseudo-obstruction. An ileostomy was recommended to manage colonic pseudo-obstruction. However, after multiple meetings with the family the parents declined the ileostomy. The infant was discharged home with the family at 9 months on hospice care and subsequently died.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An upper gastrointestinal X-ray with air contrast was performed at an outlying facility and showed a distended stomach that appeared to be filled with debris, along with a normally filled duodenum. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed at our institution, which demonstrated a trichobezoar occupying 75% of the gastric lumen extending down through the pylorus and into the duodenal bulb ().\nA few attempts to remove the hair with scissors and forceps were made, but none were successful. Exploratory laparotomy and gastrostomy were performed afterward in which the bezoar was removed successfully and without any complications. It measured 17 × 6 × 7 cm and weighed 2.33 lbs. The patient recovered well and was discharged home with psychiatry clinic follow-up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One month prior to presentation to the ED, the patient noted some shortness of breath on exertion. Three weeks prior to presentation, she developed a rash on her legs, along with bruising, and right knee swelling that made it difficult to ambulate. She also endorsed increased fatigue, weakness, and bleeding from her gingiva. She had been seen several times previously by her primary care physician, but a diagnosis had not yet been discovered. The patient denied any recent trauma, fevers, weight or appetite changes, chest pain, cough, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, bloody stools, hematuria, or menorrhagia.\nHer past medical history was significant for anxiety, depression, asthma and anorexia nervosa (since resolved) and specifically negative for coagulopathies. Her only medications included escitalopram and albuterol inhaler. Family history was noncontributory and specifically negative for coagulopathies, autoimmune disorders and leukemia. Social history was significant for a specific diet consisting of only peanut butter crackers, strawberry Nutri-Grain bars, and fish sticks. She denied tobacco, alcohol or illicit drug use.\nOn physical examination, the patient was afebrile, hypotensive to 86/58 mmHg, tachycardic to 112 beats per minute, with a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. She was pale and thin appearing, in no acute distress. Oral examination was significant for a region of gingival hyperplasia along the left upper gingival line (), and petechiae beneath the tongue. Cardiovascular exam was significant for a tachycardic rate, but regular rhythm, 2+ peripheral pulses and normal capillary refill. Pulmonary and abdominal exams were within normal limits. Skin exam demonstrated petechiae on the bilateral lower extremities along with scattered ecchymoses (). The right knee was also swollen and ecchymotic () with tenderness along the joint line and decreased range of motion secondary to pain. The remainder of the physical exam was within normal limits.\nED laboratory results were significant for hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL, a platelet count of 146 x 10/dL, iron of 32 mcg/dL, C-reactive protein of 34.2 mg/L and negative urine pregnancy test. The remainder of the laboratory studies including complete blood count, coagulation studies, complete metabolic profile, iron profile, urine drug screen, hepatitis panel, and iron profile were all within normal limits. Chest and right knee radiographs were also within normal limits. An arthrocentesis of the right knee joint revealed 600,000 red blood cells and 378 white blood cells. It was negative for crystals and organisms. The patient was admitted to the medicine service for further evaluation with a presumed diagnosis of vitamin C deficiency.\nWhile she was inpatient, laboratory studies demonstrated hematuria, new and worsening anemia and leukopenia, and persistent thrombocytopenia. Anti-nuclear antibody, direct antiglobulin profile, copper and vitamin D were all within normal limits. An ascorbic acid level was <0.1 mg/dL (normal 0.2–1.5 mg/dL). Dermatology believed the patient’s presentation to be consistent with vitamin C deficiency; however, she declined confirmatory biopsy of petechial lesions. The patient received vitamin C supplementation. After improvement of all laboratory values, she was discharged home to continue vitamin C and iron supplementation outpatient. Follow-up with the hematologist demonstrated vitamin C compliance and resolution of all symptoms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pain had awoken the patient from sleep a few hours prior to arrival. She also complained of mild palpitations, which were non-exertional in nature. She denied any fevers or chills or any other associated symptoms except for decreased appetite over the previous day. The patient denied any chest pain or dyspnea. She had a past history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia but denied a formal diagnosis. She was not on any anti-hypertensives. On arrival, the patient had an elevated blood pressure of 175/104 mmHg and tachycardia of 120 beats per minute. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed upon arrival in light of the tachycardia and was essentially unremarkable except for sinus tachycardia. The patient had been seen two months prior for gastritis and was noted to have an elevated creatinine at that time, which had been attributed to her chronic hypertension. On physical examination, the patient exhibited right upper and lower quadrant tenderness to palpation with an unremarkable pelvic exam. She also had mild lower extremity and abdominal wall pitting edema. Heart sounds were not muffled and organomegaly was difficult to appreciate due to obese body habitus. Her clinical presentation was concerning for appendicitis; hence, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis was ordered along with laboratory studies including liver function panel.\nHer laboratory analysis was significant for an elevated creatinine of 1.54 mg/dL (0.6–1.1 mg/dL). Her hemoglobin was 11.4 g/dL (12–15 g/dL) with microcytosis. The remaining laboratory studies including a liver function panel were within normal limits. Abdominal CT showed hepatomegaly and a large pericardial effusion. An ECG was immediately performed, which did not show any evidence of electrical alternans or a low voltage QRS. A point-of-care echocardiogram was performed, which showed a large pericardial effusion with early diastolic collapse of the right ventricular (RV) free wall as well as right atrial collapse during ventricular systole (, ). An M-mode tracing was used to further ascertain the RV free wall collapse during the diastolic phase (evidenced by mitral valve opening) (). This indicated that intrapericardial pressure transiently exceeded the RV pressure, resulting in early tamponade physiology.\nCardiothoracic surgery was consulted for definitive management. During her stay in the ED the patient remained tachycardic but her blood pressure decreased to 140/110 mmHg, also indicative of tamponade physiology due to the narrow pulse pressure. The patient was taken to the operating room for pericardial window. A total of 1,100 mL of serous fluid was removed from the pericardium with immediate improvement of her hemodynamic state.\nPost-operatively the patient underwent laboratory analysis to assess for SLE. She was found to be antinuclear antibody positive. Extractable nuclear antigen screen was also positive with elevated anti-Smith antibody, anti-ribonucleoprotein antibody, anti-Sjogrens syndrome-related type A antibody, and anti-cardiolipin antibody, confirming her diagnosis of SLE. Patient was managed with oral steroids and discharged in stable condition with outpatient rheumatology follow-up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two weeks prior to presentation, the patient was involved in a motor vehicle crash (MVC). The vehicles were moving slowly and sustained little damage. The airbags did not deploy and the patient was belted. She subsequently developed a series of headaches that persisted for a week and then resolved. Two days before presenting to our ED, she was seen at another ED for intermittent, crampy abdominal pain accompanied by vomiting, fevers to 38.9°C, and headache. She was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and discharged, but she did not take the nitrofurantoin she was prescribed. These symptoms continued on the day of presentation to our ED.\nShe had a past medical history of sickle cell trait. She did not take any medications and she had no drug allergies. Her family history was notable for epilepsy and systemic lupus erythematosus. She denied any tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use. She was a recent high school graduate.\nShe was alert and in no acute distress on physical exam. She was afebrile (37.1°C) with a heart rate of 90 beats/minute, blood pressure 135/85 mmHg, and her oxygen saturation was 99% while breathing room air. She weighed 100.5 kg and was five feet, six inches in height, had a body mass index of 36.9 kg/m2, and was well developed and well nourished. Her head was normocephalic and atraumatic, and mucus membranes were dry. Pupils were equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation; the extra ocular movements were normal. Sclera were anicteric and fundi were without papilledema. The neck was supple and without lymphadenopathy or carotid bruits. Her lungs had coarse breath sounds bilaterally but no wheezes, crackles, or rhonchi. There were no retractions or increased work of breathing. Heart was regular, rate and rhythm, without murmurs, rubs or gallops. The abdomen was soft with normal bowel sounds and without distention, tenderness, rebound or guarding. There was no costovertebral angle tenderness. The extremities had no edema, had 2+ pulses and were without tenderness or deformity.\nNeurologic examination showed cranial nerves II–XII intact, 5/5 strength throughout all extremities, normal muscle bulk/tone and intact sensation. Her speech was clear. The patient was noted to be withdrawn and have a flat affect. She followed commands, answered most questions appropriately but occasionally was confused. She was oriented to self but not to place or time.\nInitial laboratory results are shown in –. Because of her mental status changes and history of fever, a lumbar puncture was done.

She described the pain as constant with an acute worsening approximately three hours prior to arrival. The pain was sharp, 10/10 in intensity, and associated with diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. She reported taking ibuprofen for her symptoms, which provided little relief. She denied a history of dysuria, change in vaginal discharge, or being sexually active. She was seen by her primary care physician 12 days prior with similar but less severe pain. She was diagnosed with gastritis and prescribed ranitidine 150mg twice daily and ondansetron 4mg as needed for her symptoms. She was otherwise healthy, with no reported prior medical problems or surgeries. She was a senior in high school, lived with her parents and did not smoke, drink alcohol or use illicit substances.\nOn physical exam the patient’s vital signs were temperature 98.0°F, pulse 85, blood pressure 128/72, respiratory rate 18, and pulse oximetry 98% on room air. She was well nourished but in obvious distress from pain. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness over McBurney’s point with focal peritonitis. Pelvic exam was unremarkable, with normal discharge and without cervical motion tenderness or adnexal masses or tenderness. Rectal examination was performed, which demonstrated brown Guaiac negative stool.\nLaboratory data were remarkable for a negative urine HCG. Urinalysis showed small leukocyte esterase, nitrite negative and without hematuria or pyuria on microscopic analysis. Her white blood cell count was 6,200 mcl, otherwise normal complete blood count, electrolytes and creatinine. Serum lactate was 0.96 mEq/L. Liver function tests showed an elevated LDH of 519 U/L, normal bilirubin and transaminases. Lipase was elevated at 87 U/L.\nThe time course of symptoms and the degree of distress initially led the EP to consider ovarian torsion, but with the tenderness localizing to McBurney’s point and normal pelvic examination, a computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen pelvis was ordered. The study was protocoled for appendicitis (intravenous contrast only). This study revealed pneumoperitoneum centered within the greater sac of the upper anterior abdomen and free fluid in the pelvis ( and ). This was favored to be secondary to a perforated duodenal ulcer and general surgery was emergently consulted.\nThe patient was admitted to the general surgery service and underwent an exploratory laparoscopy. She was found to have a small, perforated ulcer in the first portion of her duodenum, which was repaired with a tongue of omentum, known as a Graham patch. Her postoperative course was uneventful. Serologic testing for H. pylori antibody was significantly elevated at 2.8, U/ml, indicating an active infection, and her gastrin level was normal. She was treated for H. pylori with amoxicillin/clarithromycin/bismuth and was discharged on postoperative day 3. Four weeks later, upon completion of triple therapy, upper endoscopy demonstrated chronic gastritis and biopsies were negative for H. pylori.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She was unable to protect her airway and required intubation. Computed tomography (CT) head showed complete basal cistern effacement with 2 cm cerebellar tonsillar herniation into the foramen magnum. Raising the head of the bed caused acute bradycardia and hypotension. She was subsequently given mannitol and required prolonged Trendelenburg positioning to maintain a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 80-100 mmHg.

She was diagnosed with unclassified colitis and treated with drugs for controlling the intestinal function, and her abdominal symptoms improved. However, these symptoms recurred 1 year after the first episode. Total colonoscopy was done, which showed edema with multiple erosions in the cecum, ascending, transverse, descending and sigmoid colon. On a pathological examination of biopsied specimens, many eosinophils were found to have infiltrated the colon mucosa (Fig. a–c). She was diagnosed with EGE, and the administration of 20 mg/day of prednisolone (PSL) was started. Her symptoms were improved, and the dose of PSL was withdrawn slowly and stopped 3 months after the beginning of PSL treatment. Six months after the end of PSL treatment, she developed a fever and chest discomfort without abdominal symptoms. Laboratory tests showed a white blood cell count of 11,350/µL (neutrophils 72.6%, lymphocytes 21.5%, monocytes 4.7%, eosinophils 0.9%, basophils 0.3%); hemoglobin, 8.7 g/dL; platelet count, 634,000/µL; C-reactive protein (CRP), 13.13 mg/dL; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), 76 mm/h; serum albumin, 2.3 g/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 12.9 mg/dL; serum creatinine, 0.36 mg/dL; D-dimer 1.40 µg/dL; anti-nuclear antibody, < 40; PR3 ANCA, < 0.1 IU/mL and MPO ANCA, < 0.1 IU/mL. An HLA typing analysis revealed positivity for A2, A31, B35, B39, DR4, DR15, C9 and C7. A 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed no abnormal findings. An echocardiogram revealed dilation of the aorta and moderate aortic regurgitation. Three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) revealed wall thickening of the aortic arch, brachiocephalic artery, right and left subclavian artery and left common carotid artery and dilation of the ascending aorta (Fig. d, e). Positron emission tomography (PET) also showed the FDG uptake in the above arteries (Fig. f). A diagnosis of TA was made based on the CT and PET findings and elevated CRP and ESR levels, which met the criteria proposed by the Japanese circulation society []. She started administration of high-dose prednisolone (1 mg/kg, 40 mg), and her symptoms were improved and the CRP and ESR levels decreased. The dose of PSL was gradually decreased and then withdrawn without relapse. During the period of this hospitalization, she underwent total colonoscopy for the assessment of EGE, which showed no edema and erosion with a little vessel augmentation in the ascending and transverse colon (Fig. g, h). On a pathological examination of biopsied specimens, only a few eosinophils had infiltrated the colonic mucosa.\nWe examined the expression of inflammatory factors associated with Th1 (IL-1β, TNFα and interferon γ), Th2 (IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13), Th17 (IL-17) and regulatory T cells (IL-10, FOXP3) in biopsied specimens of the colon before and after the PSL treatment for EGE using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Fig. ). RT-PCR showed that the IL-17 mRNA expression was specifically and greatly decreased after the PSL treatment, suggesting that overactivation of Th17 was involved in the pathogenesis of EGE.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She underwent a 2D echocardiogram, which revealed what was thought to represent a poorly visualized aneurysm. More specifically, the abnormality was initially felt to be an aneurysm of a sinus of Valsalva; though, the lack of certainty required further imaging. A prospectively gated contrast enhanced multidetector CT (MDCT) scan of the heart was performed. CT imaging () confirmed the presence of an aneurysm; however, it was located at the membranous interventricular septum immediately caudal to the level of the right coronary sinus. The aneurysm measured 1.2 × 0.9 cm, stretching the septum into the right ventricle. No accompanying VSD was evident.\nFollowing the diagnosis, the patient remained asymptomatic, but persistently bradycardic. She denied any angina upon exertion (Canadian Cardiovascular Society class 0), allowing for her status as an elite track and field athlete, typically under cardiovascular stress. The patient denied symptoms of exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or ankle edema (New York Heart Association class I). There were no reports of palpitations or any other respiratory or cardiovascular symptoms. However, the patient recounted a history of 3 syncopal episodes since age 11, previously felt to reflect vasovagal syncope rather than manifestations of underlying structural heart disease. During physical examination, the patient had a regular heart rate of 45 beats per minute and blood pressures in a seated position measuring 95/65 mmHg and 100/65 mmHg in the left and right arm, respectively. Her right lower limb systolic blood pressure was measured at 110 mmHg. On auscultation, grade 1 systolic ejection and pansystolic murmurs were heard along the left sternal border. According to the patient's mother, heart murmurs were noted at birth, but no echocardiogram was performed at the time. Jugular venous pressure and carotid upstroke remained within normal limits, and no breathing abnormalities were identified. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was ordered to assess the resiliency of her aneurysm, which was subsequently found to be intact. There was no evidence of intracardiac shunting, right ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension, or any other haemodynamic abnormalities.

She had injected herself with the compound. At the time of presentation, it was uncertain whether the patient gave herself an intravenous, subcutaneous, or intramuscular dose of chlorpyriphos. However, as a professional paramedic it is likely that she was attempting intravenous administration since she had the expertise and access to syringes and needles.\nThe exposure reportedly occurred 24 hours prior to presentation, during an attempted suicide. She had presented with a few episodes of vomiting and lacrimation at the rural hospital. Her initial management for the poisoning was done with atropine and pralidoxime (2-PAM). Nasogastric suction and Foley catheterisation was done at the rural district hospital. Intravenous access was secured. She was then referred for higher level of intensive care to a tertiary care centre.\nOn presentation to our hospital she was alert, well oriented, and cooperative, with a Glasgow coma score of 15. Her vital signs were stable (Pulse: 76 beats per minute, BP: 110/70 mmHg, RR: 14 breaths per minute, Temperature: 99°F, SPO2: 98% on room air). Pupils were of normal size and reactive to light bilaterally. Plantar reflexes and deep tendon reflexes were normal bilaterally. There were no fasciculations. Examination of the chest showed bilateral equal air entry with no crepitation or wheezing. As she had minimal features of OP poisoning, atropine was not continued as a treatment.\nInvestigations at admission showed normal renal function, liver function, and normal serum levels of sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. Arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.40, PO2: 95 mmHg and PCO2 of 37 mmHg. Her cholinesterase levels were not assayed due to unavailability of the test at our facility. After 12 hours of symptom-free interval, she developed swelling at the OP injection site (Figure ). Her total leukocyte count was measured, which resulted as 26,400/cu mm, with 77% neutrophils and 23% lymphocytes. The injection site was warm to touch and erythematous, but without fluctuance. Radiographic analysis with an ultrasound was done to rule out an abscess, foreign bodies, or subcutaneous air. Even though there was no fever, a diagnosis of cellulitis, combined with irritant dermatitis due to the hydrocarbon component of the OP solvents, was suspected. The patient was given intravenous antibiotics antibiotics to cover a broad spectrum of microbial agents (cloxacillin and metronidazole) as well as oral Ibuprofen for pain.\nAfter seven days of treatment, the patient developed worsening swelling and increased pain. Her motor function as measured via the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale on the involved hand was 3/5 in comparison to the uninvolved contralateral limb (4/5). She also developed fever recorded up to 101°F. Her daily total leucocyte counts had no decreasing trends despite antibiotic treatment, which triggered evaluation for an abscess at the injection site. Ultrasound-guided aspiration of the lesion was done, and 5 mL of pus was aspirated followed by incision and debridement. Her clinical course after that was uneventful. She was discharged after 12 days of hospitalization.\nFollowing her clinical recovery, she was evaluated by psychiatrists and it was revealed that injection of poison was an impulsive act due to familial disputes. Follow up visit was planned after 1 week of daily dressing changes and oral antibiotics at home.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A diagnostic image of her brain showed minimal changes such as mild brain edema, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed lymphocyte pleocytosis suggesting inflammatory changes. As the first presumptive diagnosis was either viral encephalitis or autoimmune encephalitis, intravenous high dose steroids, acyclovir, and glycerol were administrated. Several days after her admission, she also showed involuntary movements, disturbance of consciousness, and central hypoventilation; she was managed by assisted respiration and medicated with midazolam and propofol. Since autoimmune encephalitis was the most possible diagnosis according to further examinations, plasma exchange treatment was also started, and the patient was introduced to our department for examination for a potential ovarian teratoma. Nevertheless, neither internal examination nor transvaginal ultrasonography detected an ovarian teratoma. T1-weighted pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 5 × 7 mm fat intensity in the right ovary that showed the possibility of a teratoma (). T2-weighted pelvic MRI showed that a large number of similar-sized ovarian follicles surrounded the teratoma (). Initially, abdominal computed tomography (CT) with 10 mm slice thickness did not detect any fatty component in the right ovary. However, by referencing to the MRI findings, CT with 1 mm slice thickness eventually detected the fatty component in the right ovary. The mean CT number of that showed −62.5 HU (Figures and ).\nAfter 18 days from the first visit to our hospital, the patient underwent a laparoscopic operation for complete resection of the right ovarian teratoma. The macroscopic appearance of the right ovary did not show any abnormalities (). We performed a partial resection of the right ovary by removing small pieces at a time starting from the most likely location of the teratoma according to the diagnostic image (). The first resected 22 × 22 mm ovarian piece contained an intact 5 × 7 mm cystic tumor in which we macroscopically identified fat and hair components (). The pathological diagnosis was mature cystic teratoma containing component of brain tissue (Figures –).\nAn anti-NMDAR-antibody test was positive in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid 1 month after the surgery. From these results and her clinical course, the patient was diagnosed with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. After the surgery, clinical findings and symptoms are gradually improving. However, the recovery of her conscious level was slow and insufficient; 50 mg/m2 of cyclophosphamide in one course was administered 6 months after the operation. After 2 courses of cyclophosphamide, she showed drastic recovery, such as the complete elimination of involuntary movements and complete restoration of consciousness.

An apical rumble and a harsh second heart sound were heard in physical examination. Echocardiographic examination revealed a large mid-trabecular VSD with bidirectional shunt and the widest diameter measuring 22 mm on 2D echocardiography (ECHO) (Figure ; Additional file ). The defect was located 9 mm proximal to the moderator band. Left and right heart cavities were enlarged; left ventricle, left atrium and right ventricle end-diastolic diameters were respectively 68 mm (Z score: +8.23), 44 mm (Z score: +6.22) and 41 mm (Z score: +10.3). Pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, which we were able to measure due to pulmonary insufficiency, was 58 mmHg. Before and after the vasoreactivity test with inhaled iloprost performed during cardiac catheterization, average aortic pressure was 65 → 86 mmHg, average pulmonary artery pressure: 58 → 73 mmHg, Qp/Qs: 1.6 → 3.2, PVR: 4.6 → 4.3 Wood/U/m2 and PVR/SVR: 0.5 → 0.2 (Table ).\nOn left-ventricular angiocardiogram, the largest end-diastolic defect diameter was 21 mm. The closure procedure was performed with transthoracic echocardiographic guidance, using a 24 mm Cera septal occluder (CSO, Lifetech Scientific Co., ltd, Shenzhen, China) and a 14 F sheath dilator to make a 4.5-5 mm opening (Figures and ). Measured immediately after the procedure and during cardiac catheterization one month later, average aortic pressure was 75 → 75 mmHg, average pulmonary artery pressure: 66 → 30 mmHg, Qp/Qs 1.5 → 1.4, PVR: 4.4 → 2.9 Wood/U/m2 and PVR/SVR: 0.4 → 0.2 (Table ).\nTransthoracic echocardiographic examination performed 24 hours after the procedure showed a max 35–40 mmHg gradient between the left and right ventricles through the fenestration. At the follow-up examination one month later, the gradient level was the same and there was a 50 drop in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure compared to the pre-procedure value.The patient had a normal sinus rhythm prior to the procedure. After the procedure, we observed sporadic early ventricular systoles and a nodal rhythm disorder that started after approximately 12 hours and spontaneously reverted to normal 9 days later. The patient was put on dexamethasone for the nodal rhythm. Propranolol was started after Holter ECG showed intermittent non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) attacks. When the initially intermittent nodal rhythm became permanent, the patient was switched to sotalol. The last ECG and Holter ECG showed a normal sinus rhythm with sporadic early ventricular systoles and no VT attacks (Figures and ). Holter ECG performed 1 month later showed no early ventricular systoles.\nThe patient was closely monitored for hemolysis due to the fenestration of the device, but none was observed.\nThe patient’s dyspnea (NYHA score 2–3 upon admission) started to recede on the 4-5th day after the procedure and was graded as 1–2 in the follow-up examination 1 month later.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The indication for the appendicectomy was for an apparent appendicitis following a vague history of right iliac fossa pain. An attempted closure of the fistula failed. On examination, she was clinically dehydrated and exhausted but not toxic. She had no constitutional symptoms and the vital signs were normal. There was a persistent and high output (greater than 1 L/24 h) intestinal fistula in the right iliac fossa consistent with a cecal fistula. She was resuscitated with appropriate fluids and because of the persistent output from the high-pressure caecum a decision was made for surgical correction two days later. At laparotomy, there was a cecal fistula from the dehisced appendix stump. Apart for significant ileocecal lymphadenopathy the rest of the abdomen appeared normal. Following extensive lavage of the operation field with saline solution, an ileocecal resection with end-to-end anastomosis of the ileum and ascending colon was performed. The histology of the operative specimen confirmed a B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma consistent with Burkitt’s lymphoma. She had a stormy post-operative recovery and when fully recovered underwent a 6-month course of chemotherapy (i/v cyclophosphamide and vincristine together with oral prednisolone) having tested as HIV seronegative prior to its commencement.

At the urology department, she had been seen a year prior due to repeated urinary infections, perhaps related to the presence of an ectopic left pelvic kidney. In June 2004, as a consequence of persistent discomfort in her iliac left fossae, she underwent an intravenous pyelography (IVP), which showed her left pelvic kidney (at the level of S1). In December 2004 and January 2005, she was once again admitted to the emergency department for hypogastric pain and a urinary infection; she was hospitalized and diagnosed with pyelonephritis. Using an ultrasound scan and computed tomography, she was also diagnosed with a bilateral hydrosalpinx and genitourinary malformation: a pelvic kidney and a suggested bicornuate uterus. Under antibiotic treatment (ciprofloxacin and tobramycin), her symptoms decreased, and she returned home with only occasional pain in her hypogastric region and iliac fossae.The gynecological examination was nearly normal. Her uterus was in retroversion, but with transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) it was noticed to have a bicornuate appearance. Her ovaries were apparently normal, but there were bilateral tumors located anteuterine and they were elongated, of 6 to 7cm, suggesting endometriomas or mucinous tumors by their appearance. Cervicovaginal cultures were taken, and analysis, a new IVP and an HSG study were requested. The cultures were negative and the general analyses were normal, except for blood sedimentation rate (BSR)=36mm/hour and serum CA-125=98U/mL. The IVP showed a normal right kidney but a left pelvic kidney, and she had to undergo antibiotic treatment comprising Vibramycin® (doxycycline) and anti-inflammatory agents; thereafter an HSG was performed. This HSG showed that her uterus had a bicornuate appearance and bilateral hydrosalpinx (see Figure ), but after this test was performed she was admitted to the hospital for the possible reactivation of PID. Once again, the cultures were negative for syphilis and HIV but her BSR was 66 and she had a low-grade fever (37° to 37.5°C). She was given antibiotic treatment comprising clindamycin and Vibramycin® (doxycycline); the repeated TVU was similar to previous ones, showing bilateral solid-cystic tumors, such as abscesses, endometriomas or mucinous tumors, with increased Doppler vascularization, but with resistance index=0.7 (November 2005). After clinical improvement, a programmed surgical intervention was proposed and, in the meantime, she was discharged from the hospital. One month later, her BSR was 44 and her serum CA-125=424U/mL. At the time, the elective laparotomy was performed (December 2005) and revealed large pelvic abscesses located anteuterus, especially on the left side, with converged tubes, the bladder, the sigmoid colon and a large left pyosalpinx. On the right adnexum, the large pyosalpinx was free (floating pyosalpinx). Her ovaries showed some adhesions but seemed normal; her uterine fundus was also normal indicating a septate uterus. The rest of her abdominal cavity and gastrointestinal tract seemed normal. Drainage, adhesiolysis and bilateral salpingectomy (see Figure ) were performed and cultures were taken. We touched her left kidney at the height of the promontory. The postoperative course was normal.\nThe cultures of the abscess samples taken during the laparotomy initially showed the following: Gram stain, negative; Ziehl–Neelsen stain, negative for alcohol-acid resistant bacilli; and culture for aerobic and anaerobic germs, negative. The samples continued to be cultured and, after several days, were found to be positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which was in agreement with the histopathological result. The culture in liquid medium gave a similar positive result and the samples that were sent to a reference center were found to be sensitive to anti-TB drugs (streptomycin, rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide). The histopathological study showed bilateral granulomatous abscessificated salpingitis with suspicion of GTB (see Figure ).\nThen, after the TB infection was confirmed, she was referred to the Infectious Diseases Unit of our hospital where she followed a tuberculostatic treatment with Rimcure (rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide) and afterwards Rifinah® (rifampicin and isoniazid) for 6 months. The sputum culture obtained before the beginning of the treatment was negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and the Ziehl–Neelsen stain and the urine cultures (in Löwenstein–Jensen medium and liquid medium) performed in April 2006 were also negative. She continued to have normal menstruation and after having finished the 6 months of treatment in October 2006 she did not return for further follow-up.\nFour years later (October 2010), the now 23-year-old patient was again sent to our gynecology out-patient department due to discomfort in her left iliac fossae, dysmenorrhea and the suspicion of an ovarian cyst. The results of the gynecological examination, the TVU and all analyses practiced were normal. She was attempting to become pregnant and in February 2011 she requested assisted reproduction techniques; she was remitted to the corresponding unit for IVF. Afterwards, she did have a pregnancy but it ended in abortion. The serological analyses for toxoplasmosis, syphilis and HIV-AIDS conducted in February 2012 were negative (rubella positive). Presently, she presents with normal menstruations and is waiting for a new IVF cycle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She was in good health with no history of systemic disease or syndrome. Intraoral examination revealed a class I molar relationship with a centered dental midline and increased anterior overbite. A diastema of 2 mm between 22 and 23 was observed. Clinical examination of the maxillary teeth revealed a small canine showing signs of attrition on the right side with no mobility (). There was a small caries on the distal aspect of the tooth. In order to detect permanent canine, palpation of the labial sulcus and the palatal side of the alveolar process failed to indicate the presence of unerupted canine.\nA panoramic radiograph was taken to detect the presence and the location of the permanent canine and to check for any other anomalies. The radiograph showed that the right permanent canine was missing and the erupted canine was deciduous with its small root, short crown size, and thin enamel structure. The deciduous canine was persisting with root resorption grade 1 [] and all third molar germs were also missing (). The clinical history that ruled out any possibility of the permanent canine had been extracted or the patient had undergone dental trauma. There was no relevant family history for this condition. No other tooth anomalies were observed. However an irregularly shaped radiopacity in the left third molar region of the mandible was remarkable (). The lesion was diagnosed as idiopathic osteosclerosis on periapical view ().\nThe patient was referred to the Department of Restorative Dentistry for the restoration of the decayed tooth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Surgical excision of the tumor had been performed twice previously, however, the tumor had recurred. Histological analysis revealed that the tumor was a rhabdomyosarcoma. On initial examination, the caudal right forelimb was covered by the tumor and the animal was incapacitated in the affected limb. The risk of recurrence and the treatment options were explained to the owners, which included surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Complete surgical excision was considered to be too complex, as the tumor border was unclear. HTH experimental therapy was recommended and the animal was enrolled in the clinical trial, with the owners’ written informed consent. A tissue ablation device for veterinary medicine (AMTC 200; AdMeTech Co., Ltd., Ehime, Japan) was used to administer the HTH treatment. On day 0, HTH therapy was performed with no anesthesia or sedation. Three needles of the device were inserted into the tumor tissue at 6-mm intervals and the HTH therapy was performed for 10 min at 65°C.

Additionally, she reported right-sided weakness. Six weeks prior to this presentation, she met the criteria for a diagnosis of SLE with arthritis, a photosensitive malar rash, and serum serology positivity for anti-nuclear antibodies (1:5120) as well as anti-double stranded DNA and anti-ribonuclear protein antibodies. A regimen of oral prednisone (10 mg twice daily) and hydroxychloroquine (200 mg twice daily) was begun. In the weeks subsequent to the diagnosis and treatment of SLE, and prior to her hospitalization, the patient had a positive home pregnancy test, which was followed by an unusually heavy menstrual cycle and presumed spontaneous abortion. The patient did not seek medical attention, and therefore no uterine manipulation or evacuation was performed. The patient’s family history is significant for a maternal aunt and paternal cousin with SLE, and a maternal great-uncle who died from Libman-Sacks endocarditis.\nAt the time of the acute presentation, she was febrile to 38.9°C, oriented to self only, and had positive Kernig and Brudzinski signs. A computed tomography scan of the head revealed an extra-axial fluid collection in the right frontotemporal region, with a mild local mass effect, but no midline shift and normal ventricles. Intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone were initiated and the patient was transferred to our institution.\nOn arrival to our pediatric intensive care unit, the patient’s temperature was 38.8°C, blood pressure was 145/76 mmHg, heart rate was 70 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 100% on room air. She was drowsy and irritable when aroused, complaining of continued severe headache and neck pain. Neurological exam was significant for photophobia and meningismus. The remainder of the neurological exam and the ocular exam were normal. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed 1525 white blood cells/µL (91% neutrophils), 65 red blood cells/µL, 252 mg/dL protein, and 56 mg/dL glucose. An MRI of the brain with and without contrast revealed a moderately sized extra-axial effusion with secondary inflammatory response (\n and\n) and punctate diffusion abnormalities within the dependent portion of the lateral ventricles, consistent with pus or debris. The CSF culture was negative for bacteria, likely secondary to receipt of antibiotics prior to sampling, but the blood culture prior to antibiotic receipt grew GBS. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was not performed. CSF studies for other pathogens, including cryptococcal antigen, detection of herpes simplex and varicella viruses by PCR, and specific cultures for acid-fast bacilli and fungi, were negative. Upon identification of GBS, vancomycin and ceftriaxone were discontinued, and treatment was continued with intravenous penicillin G (4,000,000 units every 4 hours) for two weeks. The patient showed rapid improvement on antibiotic therapy and had resolution of all neurologic symptoms within one week of admission. She was discharged to receive intravenous ceftriaxone for one additional week at home.\nNotably, the patient’s SLE was severely active during the course of this acute illness. Initial laboratory results at our institution demonstrated anti-Smith, anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies. She also had severe hypocomplementemia, doubling of serum creatinine, and nephrotic range proteinuria as assessed by 24-hour urine collection. Subsequent kidney biopsy demonstrated class V lupus nephritis. Induction therapy with intravenous methylprednisolone was started, which was then changed to oral prednisone (30 mg twice daily), mycophenolate mofetil (1000 mg twice daily), and hydroxychloroquine (400 mg once daily). Her serologically active SLE began to improve after her course of methylprednisolone, but was still active at the time of discharge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On January 24, biological tests showed the following: white blood cells: 3500/μL (N 4000–11000), platelets: 52000/μL (N 150000–350000), aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 2622 U/L (N 11–42), alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 2628 U/L (N 9–42), alkaline phosphatase (ALP): 110 U/L (N 30–125), gamma glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT): 272 U/L (N 9–35), and total bilirubin: 61 μmol/L (N 7–25). Prothrombin time was 66% (N > 70) with an International Normalized Ratio of 1.21, but dosage of factor V activity was normal as well as kidney function. Blood paracetamol concentration was not measured at admission due to minor exposure. At hospital admission, she was alert with a slightly tender liver and no signs of chronic liver disease. Abdominal imaging was normal except for mild liver and spleen enlargement (). Viral hepatitis (A, B, C, and E) as well as HIV, CMV, EBV, and herpes simplex virus tested negative. Autoimmune testing (total IgG, antinuclear, antiactin, and anti-LKM1 antibodies) was negative and ceruloplasmin was normal. Transaminase levels remained elevated and bilirubin levels increased to 335 μmol/L. On January 28 a transjugular liver biopsy was performed with a portosushepatic venous pressure gradient of 8 mmHg. Histology showed extensive centrilobular hepatocyte necrosis with collapse. Hepatocytes were ballooned with clear cytoplasm. Mild inflammatory periportal cell infiltrations as well as rare areas of micro- and macrovesicular steatosis were also observed (). These histological alterations were consistent with acute drug-induced liver injury (DILI). She received a 3-day course of intravenous N-acetylcysteine according to the recent literature reporting transplant-free survival in acute severe nonacetaminophen liver injury [, ], and liver function tests were monitored until normalization 6 weeks later ().\nCausality assessment by the Naranjo score and the Liverpool Adverse Drug Reaction Causality Assessment Tool [] both indicated tocilizumab as a probable cause of our patient's acute liver failure.

On June 3, 2013, a 6.0×6.0-cm exophytic friable mass was identified in the uterine cervix by colposcopic examination. On histological examination, the mass was diagnosed as SCCC (). Immunohistochemistry revealed positive staining for chromogranin A (CgA), cytokeratin, cluster of differentiation (CD)56, synapsin (Syn), Ki67 (50%+) and human papillomavirus (HPV). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed a 5.8×5.7-cm cervical carcinoma and swelling of the lymph nodes in the pelvis (). Based on the histological and radiographical observations (), the tumor was diagnosed as SCCC, and classified as International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IB2 (). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) was administered, which consisted of four cycles of treatment with intravenous (i.v) cisplatin (70 mg/m2, days 1–3) and i.v etoposide (70 mg/m2, days 1–5) for ~9 weeks. Atypical vaginal spotting disappeared following the first cycle of therapy. After the fourth cycle of NACT, MRI revealed a 90% decrease in tumor size when compared with previous MRI scans of the cervical mass and an 80% decrease in size of the lymph nodes (). Three weeks after completing NACT, the patient received 3D intensity-modulated radiation therapy with a total dose of 44 Gy administered to the pelvis and 54 Gy to the pelvic lymph nodes. Image-guided high-dose-rate intracavity brachytherapy at a dose of 25 Gy in combination with low dose Nedaplat (40 mg/m2) was administered for eight weeks. MRI showed complete remission had been achieved following radiotherapy. On February 20, 2014, the patient was disease-free without signs of recurrence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She was primiparous and in her second pregnancy, without complications in her previous pregnancy. She had not attended prenatal care consultations. Her personal history included traces of sickle cell disease. She was admitted to the Emergency Service of Hospital São Paulo, Paulista School of Medicine, Federal University of São Paulo (EPM-UNIFESP) with a complaint of high-intensity holocranial headache in association with blurring of vision and pain in the epigastric region, focused on a narrow band, which had started on the preceding day. There was a report that the patient had had an episode of convulsion during the previous night and another episode while being brought to the hospital.\nDuring the initial attendance, the patient was conscious and presented with arterial pressure of 140/90, heart rate of 80 bpm, equally photoreactive pupils, agitation, spatial orientation, temporal disorientation, muscle disorders, markedly diminished visual acuity, edema of ++/4+, uterine height of 25 cm, normal uterine tonus, normal heartbeats, and absence of uterine dynamics.\nIn the admission room, the ocular fundus was examined, showing papilledema. An ultrasound examination showed a pregnancy of 31 weeks, fetal growth restriction with normal Doppler velocimetry, and oligohydramnios. Ophthalmic artery Doppler showed a peak ratio of 0.88. Cranial tomography was performed with contract medium () and was subsequently complemented with cranial angioresonance imaging (), showing a bilateral occipital hypoattenuating area that also reached the parietal region, without respecting anatomical divisions and without corresponding to cerebral sulci or presenting any mass effect. This finding was suggestive of PRES, with cortical blindness. The laboratory tests produced the following results: Hb 13.4 g/dL; Ht 41.7%; platelets: 174,000/uL; creatinine: 1.23 mg/dL; urea: 31 mg/dL; total bilirubin: 0.89 mg/dL; TGO 188 U/L; TGP 131 U/L; DHL 503 U/L; proteinuria in a single sample < 0.15 g/L, normal coagulogram, normal biochemistry of cerebrospinal fluid, and culturing without abnormalities; and serological tests negative (HIV, VDRL, hepatitis B and C, toxoplasmosis, rubella, and cytomegalovirus).\nIn the light of the initial hypotheses of eclampsia, partial HELLP syndrome, and PRES, monitored treatment with magnesium sulphate, hydralazine, and corticoids was started in the intensive care unit. The patient evolved with worsening of the symptoms and peak pressure, and it was therefore decided to conclude the pregnancy through cesarean section, with postoperative care in an intensive care unit. The newborn was female, weighing 1670 g, with Apgar scores of 3 in the first minute and 8 in the fifth minute; the placenta weighed 340 g.\nOn the first and second postoperative days, the cortical blindness improved, but the band of abdominal pain continued, with worsening of the laboratory tests: Hb 6.8 g/dL; Ht 20.4%; platelets: 128,000/uL; creatinine: 1.16; urea: 36 mg/dL; hemolysis and elevation of hepatic transaminases; normal coagulogram; and proteinuria: 1.22 g/24 h. Because of the abdominal symptoms, resonance imaging of the upper abdomen was requested (), which was subsequently complemented with cholangiopancreatography.\nOn the second postoperative day, the microcirculation was evaluated by means of the SDF technique () through the oral mucosa. It was observed that the impairment of the vessels was coherent with a condition of systemic endothelial lesion. However, this assessment was made after hospitalization, with the condition of decompensation already advanced.\nThe patient was kept in hospital for 14 days and, over this period, all the laboratory tests and imaging examinations became normal again. The patient was then released and outpatient follow-up was maintained.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initial examination showed patella ballottement and positivity on the apprehension test of the patella. Three of five Carter and Wilkinson scores were positive []. Plain radiography of the patellofemoral joint showed Insall-Salvati ratios of 1.1 on both the left and right sides, with no evidence of patella alta. The sulcus angles on the left and right sides were 132° and 127°, respectively, showing normal morphology of the femoral groove. The congruence angles were 32° and −8°, respectively; the tilting angles (the angle between the patella width line and the tangent to the anterior condyles) [] were 40° and 17°, respectively; and the lateral shift ratios [] were 57% and 17%, respectively, indicating lateral subluxation and lateral inclination of the left patella. Patella tracking was along the lateral femoral condyle. Plain radiography of the entire lower extremity showed no abnormal findings. On CT scan, bone avulsion was noted in the suprapatellar pouch. Tibial tubercle-trochlear groove (TT-TG) distance was 15 mm []. MRI showed injury to the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL), as well as an osteochondral fragment in the suprapatellar pouch. T2-weighted imaging showed bone bruises in the lateral femoral condyle and the medial surface of the patellar joint. The coronal view showed a cartilage defect on the weight-bearing surface covering the distal aspect of the lateral femoral condyle (). Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed as having left patellar dislocation and osteochondral injury of the lateral femoral condyle, and surgery was performed. On arthroscopy, cartilage injury was observed on the joint surface of the medial patella. A 2 × 1.5-cm free osteochondral fragment was present in the suprapatellar pouch, consistent with the size of the posterolateral osteochondral defect of the lateral femoral condyle (). The hematoma on the osteochondral defective region was removed, and the free osteochondral fragment was fixed with a poly-L-lactide (PLLA) pin (diameter, 2 mm; length, 20 mm) (). The patella attachment site of the vastus medialis of the quadriceps muscle was moved toward the inferolateral direction. The joint was immobilized for one week after surgery. Range of motion training and partial weight bearing were initiated at 2 weeks, and full weight bearing was initiated at 5 weeks.

She also complained of food lodgement in the same tooth since 6–8 months. Patient's medical history was noncontributory and vital signs were within normal limit.\nExtra-oral examination showed a soft diffuse swelling on the right lower border of the mandible extending up to the angle of the mandible. Clinical examination revealed a deep proximoocclusal carious lesion in relation to right MFM. The tooth was severely tender on vertical percussion and palpation. There was no sinus tract present in the involved tooth. The periodontal status was normal (probing depth < 3 mm) with no mobility. The tooth gave a negative response to all three pulp vitality tests (electric, cold, and heat).\nRadiographic examination () revealed a deep carious lesion involving the distal pulp horn and widening of the periodontal ligament space. Intraoral periapical radiograph was indicative of four canals in the distal and two in the mesial root. Clinical and radiographic findings lead to a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic periapical abscess and treatment planned was of nonsurgical endodontic treatment. Inferior alveolar nerve block was administered to the patient with 2% Lignocaine with 1 : 100,000 epinephrine (Lignox 2%, Indoco Remedies Ltd., Mumbai). After isolation with rubber dam (Hygenic Dental Dam, Colténe Whaledent, Germany), access was gained into the pulp chamber with a nonend cutting tapered fissure bur (Endo-Z, Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland). Caries was excavated and the pulp chamber was flushed with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite to remove the debris. Access cavity was extended more buccolingually to improve the visibility of the extra canals giving it a rectangular shape. Partial coronal pulp chamber calcification was encountered on entering the pulp chamber. Initially the dentinal map was explored using a DG 16 endodontic explorer (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL) which revealed 4 canal orifices mesiobuccal, mesiolingual, distobuccal, and distolingual. Dentinal bridge connecting the two distobuccal, middistal, and distolingual orifices was removed using ultrasonic tips (Proultra tips, Dentsply, and Tulsa Dental). Finally four canals were located in the distal root-distobuccal I, distobuccal II, mid-distal and distolingual. Initial canal-negotiation was carried out with numbers 6, 8, and 10 K-files (Mani, Inc., Tochigi, Japan). Working length was estimated with an apex locator (Root ZX mini-J Morita MFG. Corp., Kyoto, Japan) and confirmed with digital radiograph (). Cleaning and shaping were performed with rotary NiTi files (Twisted files, SybronEndo, Orange, CA, USA) and RC prep (Premier Dental Products, Norristown, PA, USA; 15% EDTA and 10% urea peroxide in a base of carbowax) as a lubricant. Mesial root canals (mesiobuccal and mesiolingual) were prepared to a master apical file size of 35 with 6% taper and distal canals (distobuccal I, distobuccal II, middistal, distolingual) to a master apical file size of 25 with 4% taper. Irrigation was performed with 5.25% sodium hypochlorite and 2% chlorhexidine (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO, USA) and saline was used alternatively in between them. Side-vented irrigation needles [R C Twents irrigation needle, Prime Dental Products Pvt. Ltd., Mulund, Mumbai] were used during the irrigation. Care was taken to keep the needle tip of the radiographic apex 1 mm short. 2% chlorhexidine gel was placed as the interappointment dressing and the tooth was temporized with Cavit-G (3M ESPE, United States).\nCBCT was advised to further substantiate this rare root canal anatomy and for the better understanding of the root canal configuration. An informed consent was obtained from the patient before proceeding with the CBCT of the mandible. The examination was performed with a CBCT Unit Kodak 9300 3D Imaging system with a voxel size of 0.20 mm × 0.20 mm × 0.20 mm and 5.5 cm field of view. The images were reconstructed using C S 3D Imaging Software v 3.2.9 (Carestream Dental, US). Complete morphology of the root canal system was obtained in coronal, axial, and sagittal sections of 0.2 mm thickness. CBCT () revealed 4 canal orifices which merged into two canals apically in the distal root and two separate canals in the mesial roots.\nNext appointment was scheduled after 7 days, during which patient was asymptomatic. Following anaesthesia and isolation intracanal medicament was removed with copious irrigation and ultrasonic files. The canals were flushed with 10 mL of 5.25% hypochlorite and activated with Endoactivator (Dentsply, Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) for 2-3 minutes in each canal. Final irrigation was done with 17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution and dried with absorbent paper points (Dentsply, Maillefer, Ballaigues). Master cone radiograph () was taken followed by obturation by lateral condensation technique using Gutta percha (Dentsply, Maillefer, Ballaigues) and AH plus sealer (Dentsply, DeTrey, Germany). Owing to the close proximity the distal canals to each other, they were not separately appreciable in the obturation radiograph but they could be clearly visualized in the CBCT and preoperative radiograph. Core buildup was done with composite (Para-core, Coltene, Whaledent Inc, USA) and the patient was advised a full coverage crown (). Patients were asymptomatic and the tooth was in function at 15-month follow-up (). Patient is under active follow-up thereafter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Her menstrual cycles were regular and did not complain of headache or visual disturbance. She was not on any medication except for metformin and insulin for her type 1 diabetes mellitus.\nDetailed inquiry revealed that the milky secretion was produced, particularly on seeing a newborn in her next door. The patient sat for long hours in front of a window through which she could always see the infant in the adjoining house. She further described spurting of milk on hearing newborn’s cry or even on remembering its memories. She also claims to dream of herself handling the newborn. She has never experienced similar symptoms before. However her symptoms have rapidly regressed after the neighbours had shifted with the newborn. She is a sexually inactive, school girl preparing for advanced level examination scheduled in 6 months. However she denied any symptoms suggestive of depression, anxiety or delusional disorders.\nOn examination, she was overweight with a BMI of 25.7 kgm-2, well oriented and fluent in speech. She did not have papilloedema, or other focal neurological signs. Her visual fields were normal. Both breasts were in Tanner’s stage 5.

An ultrasound examination by the admitting primary care physician revealed a vascularized tumour. During physical examination, a palpable mass was present in close proximity to her deltoid muscle. A plain X-ray examination of her left humerus showed an osteolytic lesion (Figure a) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 5.5cm tumour which had a discrete soft tissue component (Figure b). Fine needle aspiration biopsy was inconclusive, most suggestive of myositis ossificans. Overall, telangiectatic osteosarcoma could not be excluded, a fact that led us to an open biopsy. The pathology report verified the diagnosis of ABC, without any evidence of malignancy. A repeat MRI, approximately 6 weeks after the first scan, however, showed a clear progression of both the intraosseous and the extraosseous components of the tumour, raising again the suspicion of sarcoma (Figure ). This led to a second open biopsy, and the second pathology report was also consistent with an ABC. The diagnosis of an unusually aggressive ABC was set, and polidocanol sclerotherapy was initiated. She received six consecutive injections of 240mg of polidocanol under general anaesthesia and fluoroscopic guidance at approximately 3-week time intervals (Figure a), until symptoms subsided and convincing radiological findings of healing of the lesion were observed. She had no symptoms at follow-up 3 months after the last injection, and her shoulder ROM was normalized.

aMaNdA crOsS,18,F,AB-,Asthma,24-02-2023,Timothy Perez,Reid-Carey,Cigna,22918.71398,104,Urgent,16-03-2023,Ibuprofen,Normal,"An 18-year-old, nonsmoker female patient, with no history of systemic disease, was referred to the Oral Surgery Unit of the Department of Surgical and Morphological Science, University of Varese, Italy, for a fixed implant-supported prosthetic rehabilitation of the anterior mandible. One year earlier the patient had been involved in a car accident and had fractured her anterior symphysis, losing her lower incisors; in that context, internal fixation of the fracture was obtained by means of two rigid plates placed along the upper and lower border of the symphysis.\nDuring the first visit, a complete clinical and radiographic examination was carried out. The patient was wearing a removable partial denture (RPD) as an interim prosthesis to replace the missing mandibular incisors and improve her aesthetic appearance. After removal of the RPD, the first clinical assessment revealed significant contraction of the soft tissues, probably associated with a vertical and horizontal bone defect in the edentulous area, as confirmed by dental casts analysis. Clinical examination revealed unsatisfactory oral hygiene and, consequently, the patient was provided with professional oral hygiene instruction, involving reinforcement in her oral hygiene efforts, followed by a scaling and root planning of the entire dentition. Probing pocket depth (PPD) was measured using a light probing force (of approximately 25 g) with a conventional periodontal probe (PCP-UNC 15, Hu-Friedy Manufacturing, Chicago, IL, USA) at 4 sites per tooth (mesial, midbuccal, distal, and midlingual). The patient was periodontally healthy with PPD values ranging from 3 to 5 mm. Finally, for a better assessment of the bony anatomy, computed tomography (CT) datasets of the mandible were acquired in the Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) format and immediately transferred to specific segmentation software (Mimics, Materialise, Leuven, Belgium). In this software, the hard tissue threshold was carefully selected so that only bone would be reconstructed from the slices. Accordingly, it was possible to perform an accurate and complete 3D reconstruction of the mandible. Although CT evaluation and 3D reconstruction showed healing of the fracture, they also showed severe posttraumatic atrophy of the mandibular anterior ridge. In detail, a huge vertical bone defect was present in the symphyseal area (9.3, 10.0, 8.6, and 7.8 mm of alveolar bone were lost from the right lateral incisor to the left lateral incisor area, resp.) combined with a marked reduction in the horizontal alveolar ridge width (Figures -).\nGiven this problematic anatomical situation, the placement of dental implants for supporting a fixed prosthetic rehabilitation was not possible without considering some form of preprosthetic bone reconstructive surgery. Based on the detailed clinical and radiographic examinations, a bone reconstructive procedure with a custom-made synthetic scaffold, followed by delayed implant placement, was proposed to the patient. The patient was fully informed and received a thorough explanation about the planned treatment along with its potential risks and complications. She was also advised about the alternative treatment options of a fixed partial denture on natural teeth or a removable partial denture. After careful consideration, she accepted the proposed treatment and signed a written informed consent form. The study was approved by the Local Ethical Committee at the University of Varese, Italy, and was performed according to the principles outlined in the World Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki on experimentation involving human subjects, as revised in 2008.\nOne week after the signing of the informed consent form, the process for the fabrication of the anatomically shaped, custom-made hydroxyapatite scaffold started, as previously reported [, ]. In brief, the 3D reconstruction of the mandible was transferred as a stereolithographic (STL) file to a 3D CAD program (Rhinoceros, Robert McNeel & Associates, Seattle, WA, USA). With this software, it was possible to reconstruct the alveolar ridge defect virtually and design an anatomically shaped, custom-made scaffold. The anatomically shaped, custom-made scaffold included a hole in its centre to allow the placement of a fixation screw (). The 3D geometry of the scaffold was then imported into proprietary CAM software that is used to generate a set of tool-paths for fabrication on a CNC milling machine. A commercially available, synthetic micromacroporous biphasic calcium-phosphate (BCP) block, consisting of 70% beta-tricalcium phosphate and 30% hydroxyapatite (Biocer, Biocer Entwicklungs GmbH, Bayreuth, Germany), was then placed in the CNC milling machine and milled into the exact shape of the 3D project. In this way, an anatomically shaped, custom-made BCP scaffold was manufactured. In addition, a scaffold replica in polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) was fabricated; this PTFE replica was intended as a guide for the correct positioning of the hole for the fixation screw (using the BCP scaffold as a guide for drilling the hole could have led to fracture of the fragile scaffold). It took two weeks for the design and fabrication of the BCP scaffold with its replica. The BCP scaffold and its PTFE replica were sterilized before surgery.\nTwo weeks before surgery, the patient underwent periodontal treatment, involving instruction and reinforcement in her oral hygiene efforts, followed by a scaling and root planing of the entire dentition. On the day of surgery the interim removable prosthesis was removed () and local anesthesia was obtained by infiltrating articaine 4% containing 1 : 100.000 adrenaline. Following a crestal incision with two deep lateral incisions, a mucoperiosteal flap was elevated with wide exposure of the mandibular symphysis. The mental neurovascular bundles were identified and protected with a retractor. The fixation plates were unscrewed and removed. Then, the PTFE replica was placed in position and used for precise positioning of the hole for the fixation screw of the scaffold (). Once the hole for the fixation screw was precisely drilled (), the PTFE replica was removed. Prior to implantation of the BCP scaffold into the alveolar bone defect area, multiple small holes were drilled through the remaining alveolar bone into the marrow cavity, with a 1 mm round bur under copious saline irrigation. This was done to enhance bleeding of the mandibular cortex (). A preparation rich in growth factor (PRGF) was prepared, in order to promote healing and tissue regeneration. The preparation was conducted such as to obtain a platelet-rich plasma preparation, a platelet-poor plasma preparation, and a fibrin scaffold. This protocol differed from the original one described by Anitua and colleagues [] for the lack of sodium citrate and calcium chloride used as anticoagulant and activator, respectively. The platelet-rich plasma preparation was applied to the surgical site (). Once the site had been prepared the custom-made BCP scaffold was removed from its sterile packaging () and placed in position, strictly overlapping the underlying alveolar crest and creating a biological rigid fixation (). Fixation of the scaffold was obtained by means of a small titanium screw (). The BCP scaffold rapidly acted as a sponge, absorbing a large amount of blood from the surgical site (). The surgical site was finally covered and protected with a fibrin membrane (). During wound closure great care was taken to obtain a tension-free suture above the scaffold, so as to avoid ischemic damage to the mucosa and suture dehiscence (). The patient was instructed to avoid hard food and received oral antibiotics, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid 2 g/d for 6 days (Augmentin, GlaxoSmithKline Beecham, Brentford, UK). Postoperative pain was controlled by administering 100 mg of nimesulide (Aulin, Roche Pharmaceutical, Basel, Switzerland) every 12 hours for 2 days, and detailed instruction about oral hygiene was given, along with mouth rinses with 0.12% chlorhexidine (Chlorhexidine, Oral-B, Boston, MA, USA) to be administered daily for 7 days. The patient was seen on a weekly basis during the first 4 weeks. At the first control visit, 7 days after the surgery, a clinically healthy marginal area was present, and no postoperative pain or swelling was reported. There was no bleeding or wound infection. At the second control visit, 14 days after the surgery, sutures were removed (). Monthly professional plaque control supplemented this healing phase for 6 months.\nNo clinical complications were observed during the 1-year healing period. In this period, the patient wore her RPD as interim prosthesis, primarily for aesthetic reasons. One year after surgery the patient underwent a postoperative CT scan. The new CT datasets were immediately transferred to the 3D reconstruction software (Mimics, Materialise, Leuven, Belgium) for the segmentation of the mandible (Figures -). After that, the vertical and horizontal bone gain was radiographically evaluated by comparing the 3D reconstruction of the preoperative CT scan with that obtained 1 year later, using a method previously described [, ]. In brief, data from the preoperative and the postoperative CT scans were segmented using the aforementioned 3D reconstruction software. Based on the result of these segmentations, a surface mesh model was generated according to conventional matching cube algorithms, followed by automated surface mesh model generation. The postoperative mesh model was superimposed on the preoperative mesh model and rigidly aligned by anatomical landmarks with the help of software for the overlapping of digital images (Geomagic Studio, Geomagic, Morrisville, NC, USA). The distance between the 2 surface meshes was presented as color-coded graded figures to identify zones of facial bone resorption. By overlapping digital images the hard tissue gain could be confirmed ().\nSince the 3D radiographic examination showed sufficient bone increase and density for implant insertion in the treated anterior mandible, the placement of two implants was digitally planned with the aid of implant navigation software (Invivo Dental 5, Anatomage, San Jose, CA, USA) (). Two weeks later, two conical implants with internal connections (AnyRidge, MegaGen Implants Co., Ltd., Gyeongbuk, South Korea) were inserted under local anesthesia by the same surgeon who had performed the grafting procedure. Local anaesthesia was obtained by infiltrating articaine 4% containing 1 : 100.000 adrenaline. A full-thickness crestal incision was made and the soft tissue overlying the reconstructed alveolar process was elevated. The patient showed significant bone augmentation, confirming the possibility of placing two dental implants in the preplanned positions. Accordingly, two implants (3.75 × 11.5 mm) were placed in locations numbers 32 and 42 (Figures , , and ). The threads of the implants used in this study were designed to provide high insertion torque, by increasing their dimensions toward the coronal end of the implant. This specific macrotopographical feature may allow for axial and radial bone compression during implant insertion, and it may be particularly useful in regenerated areas, providing the increased primary stability. An insertion torque of 55 Ncm was registered. Implant stability was determined clinically as the absolute absence of axial or rotational movement by the removal of the implant driver without use of the stabilizing wrench.\nDuring implant surgery, two bone core biopsies (approximately 2 × 6 mm, one for each site of implant placement) were retrieved with a 2 × 10 mm trephine bur, via a transcrestal path, with the aim of performing a histologic evaluation of the augmented bone. The biopsies were immediately stored in 10% buffered formalin and were subsequently processed (Precise 1 Automated System, Assing, Rome, Italy) to obtain thin ground sections. The specimens were dehydrated in an ascending series of alcohol rinses and embedded in glycolmethacrylate resin (Technovit 7200 VLC, Heraeus Kulzer GmbH & Co., Wehrheim, Germany). After polymerization, the specimens were sectioned lengthwise along the longer axis to about 150 μm using a high-precision diamond disk saw and subsequently ground down to about 30 μm. Two sections were obtained from each specimen. The sections were stained with basic fuchsin and toluidine blue and the histologic evaluation was performed. Histological evaluation revealed compact mature bone undergoing remodelling, marrow spaces and newly formed trabecular bone surrounded by residual BCP particles. The newly formed bone appeared well organized. Close to the porous BCP particles, new bone formation was observed, with newly formed osteoid matrix undergoing mineralization. In detail, the left specimen was made of compact mature bone undergoing remodelling, with a few marrow spaces; no residual biomaterial particles were found, as only traces of BCP mixed with mineralized bone matrix were evidenced (Figures -). The right specimen was made of residual particles of BCP surrounded by compact bone. In some areas, traces of residual particles surrounded by mineralized bone matrix were found; multinucleated cells were in close contact with the BCP particles. In the marrow spaces, new blood vessels were evident (Figures -).\nThe implants were left undisturbed for a period of 3 months after which a provisional acrylic resin fixed partial denture (FPD) was provided (Figures -) which was left in situ for a further 3 months. This was replaced with the definitive metal-ceramic restoration (Figures -), which was cemented with a zinc oxide-eugenol cement (Temp-Bond, Kerr, Orange, CA, USA). Occlusion was thoroughly checked. The implant-supported FPD showed good functional and an acceptable aesthetic result.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She did not have any past medical history of GI bleeding, chronic liver disease, peptic ulcer disease or use of alcohol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. She was taking no medications prior to this presentation and denied use of any herbal or dietary supplements. Her family history was significant for hypertension in her father. Her family had no history of liver disease, colon cancer or any other GI malignancy. Her physical examination was significant for tachycardia and lethargy. Her pulse rate was 122 beats/min, and her blood pressure was 100/60mmHg. Her respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min, and her body temperature was 37.6°C. She had no abdominal pain or any stigmata of chronic liver disease. A nasogastric aspirate was negative for blood. Her laboratory values were as follows: hemoglobin, 4g/dl (normal range, 12.3 to 15.3g/dl); mean corpuscular volume, 77.2 fl (normal range, 80.0 to 96.0 fl); white blood cell count, 9000/mm3 (normal range, 4.8 to 10.8×104 mm3); platelets, 238,000/μl (normal range, 145,000 to 445,000/μl); urea, 26mg/dl (normal range, 5 to 22mg/dl); creatinine, 0.8mg/dl (normal range, 0.6 to 1.3mg/dl); serum sodium, 136mmol/L (normal range, 134 to 142mmol/L); serum potassium, 3.2mmol/L (normal range, 3.5 to 5.0mmol/L); total bilirubin, 0.6mg/dl (normal range, 0.2 to 1.2mg/dl); aspartate transaminase, 32IU/L (normal range, 5 to 34IU/L); alanine transaminase, 40IU/L (normal range, 5 to 55 IU/L); alkaline phosphatase, 87IU/L (normal range, 42 to 140IU/L); international normalized ratio, 0.9 (normal range, 0.9 to 1.1); and prothrombin time, 12.9 seconds (normal range, 11.8 to 14.3 seconds). She was resuscitated with intravenous fluids and 4U of packed red blood cells. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed, which revealed swelling in the first part of the duodenum (Figure ). The initial appearance of the swelling suggested that it was an abnormally placed or accessory papilla. There was a small, <3-mm opening on the lesion that resembled the biliary or pancreatic orifice. On gentle manipulation with a catheter, blood spurted from the swelling area, and a vessel was visible (Figures and ). Adrenaline was used for hemostasis. After hemostasis was achieved, it became clear that the lesion was most consistent with a Dieulafoy’s-like lesion and not a papilla. Band ligation was then performed (Figure ), and the patient did not develop any complications and did not have any further episodes of bleeding. The patient was eventually discharged to home in stable condition. The patient was followed up for 6 months and did not have any other episodes of GI bleeding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She had active urine sediment, serum creatinine of 1.4 mg/dl, and 24 hours urine protein of 2500 mg/day. Renal biopsy confirmed lupus nephritis, class IV, based on the International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS), with cellular crescent formation. She was admitted in internal medicine ward for further management.\nOn the day of admission, she was afebrile, not in respiratory distress, and her blood pressure was 160/95. She had periorbital edema, malar rash, and oral lesion on hard palate with normal tongue and uvula. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nWard laboratory test results revealed leukocyte count of 1.5×10\n9\n/L, absolute lymph count 0.720×10\n9\n/L, hemoglobin 8.0 g/dl, and platelet count 79×10\n9\n/L. ESR was 78 mm/hr, albumin 2.9 mg/dl with normal values of liver enzymes and alkaline phosphatase. The patient had serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dl. The results of serology tests were as follow: Antinuclear antibody (ANA) 1/360 with homogenous pattern, anti-double strand DNA antibody >240 IU/ml, anticardiolipin antibody 6.2 GPL units/ml (for the first time), and negative anti La, anti Ro, anti beta2glycoproteinI antibodies and lupus anticoagulant. Both C3 and C4 complement levels were low. Chest X-ray was normal.\nOn the evening of the day she received the second metylprednisolon pulse, developed sever, generalized sub mandibular and neck swelling progressed to stridor and hoarseness. She was afebrile, tachypnic, and had a normal appearing tongue, soft palate, and uvula. Breathing sounds and the other parts of physical examination had no significant change compared to the admission time. Serum level of C1-INH was low. She still had a normal chest X-ray.\nImipenem and vancomycin were started, after this event, enalapril was discontinued, and emergency intubation with fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed by anesthesiologist due to low oxygen saturation. Severe epiglottis and vocal cord swelling were noted in the anesthesiologist report.\nIn the ICU, antibiotics were continued and she underwent mechanical respiration. Repeated bedside sonography and color Doppler imaging failed to show any collection, hematoma, or vascular thrombosis in the neck area. Few days later, creatinine rose and urine output decreased. Peripheral blood smear was not in favor of thrombotic thrombocytopenia. Dexamethazone (200 mg) and plasmapheresis were started immediately, but she developed bloody secretions from tracheal tube and bilateral coarse rales up to mid part of both lung fields. Chest X-ray showed diffuse bilateral infiltration, suspicious to pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage ().

Menarche had occurred at age 11 years. She suffered from mild cerebral palsy (possibly due to low birth weight of 1.88 kg at 38 weeks’ gestation), mild asthma, Asperger’s syndrome, anxiety, and epileptic events from age 14 to 15 years, considered secondary to cerebral palsy. She had a ruptured appendix at age 12 years. There was no other significant past history; no drug usage; she did not smoke or drink alcohol, and had not become sexually active. Sertraline was used for treatment of anxiety from 2009 to 2010 followed by fluoxetine. There was a family history of osteoarthritis and osteopenia and of pancreatic cancer; no family history of premature menopause. The OCP was commenced at age 12 years. The attending gynecologist recorded “although her periods were reasonably normal, she was put on the pill (20 µg ethinyloestradiol and 100 µg levonorgestrol) the next year because coping with her periods made her anxiety and depression symptoms worse.” Her first HPV4 vaccination was administered at age 12 years and 9 months; the second vaccination near her 13th birthday, and the third vaccination at age 13 years and 5 months. The first HPV4 vaccination was given concomitantly with hepatitis B vaccination in the other arm. OCP usage continued for 2 years to age 14 years. It was briefly ceased at age 14 and this was followed by 3 months amenorrhea. OCP was then resumed without further investigation. At age 18 years, the OCP was again ceased and amenorrhea again ensued.\nFollicle-stimulating hormone 1 month later was elevated at 44.5 IU/L (menopausal range is 25-130 IU/L). Luteinizing hormone was 29.2 IU/L (basal range 2.0-12, midcycle peak range 8.0-90, postmenopausal range 5.0-62 IU/L). Estradiol was 157 pmol/L. She continued amenorrheic and presented again for investigation 6 months later. At this time, follicle-stimulating hormone remained elevated at 34 IU/L. Luteinizing hormone was elevated at 46 IU/L. Estrodiol (Oest2) was 413 pmol/L and progesterone 2 nmol/L. Anti-Müllerian hormone was 1.5 pmol/L (14.0-30.0 pmol/L normal; levels <14 pmol/L suggest diminished ovulatory reserve) tested by Beckman Coulter Gen II ELISA assay. Anti-Müllerian hormone repeated 6 months later was <1 pmol/L and estradiol was <37 pmol/L. At this time and at age 18 years POI was diagnosed.\nFull blood count, iron levels, liver function, blood glucose, and renal function were normal. Thyroid-stimulating hormone was normal 0.4 mIU/L (normal 0.3-3.5 mIU/L) and thyroid antibodies were normal. Prolactin was normal 294 mIU/L. Testosterone 0.9 nmol/L (normal 0.2-1.8 nmol/L); free androgen index 2.6 (normal 0.3-4.0); iron studies were normal. There were no antiadrenal or antiovarian antibodies detected. Morning cortisol was 218 nmol/L (normal range 160-650) nmol/L, ACTH 14 ng/L (normal range 9-51 ng/L), growth factor-1 27 nmol/L (normal range 21-76 nmol/L). Pelvic ultrasound performed at the time when the anti-Müllerian hormone level was 1.5 showed a normal uterus with an endometrial echo of 8.2 mm. Transvaginal ultrasound was declined and the left ovary was not visualized. The right ovary was 3.1 cm3 in size and there was a 9-mm follicle within it. Brief menstrual bleeds then occurred for 4 months before amenorrhea resumed.\nTesting for Fragile X revealed 2 normal-sized triplet alleles 23 and 37 cytosine–guanine–guanine n repeats (the normal zone is <44). Testing for galactosemia showed a normal Gal-1-P uridyl transferase-RC at 0.31 U/g hemoglobin (normal range 0.26-0.52 U/g). Records reported a vitamin B12 deficiency at age 16 years, but levels of vitamin B12 were within normal limits at 275 pmol/L (normal range 135-650 pmol/L). Karyotype was established as 46XX.\nThis young woman elected to undergo right ovary cryopreservation through Monash IVF in the hope that future developments, such as stimulation of ovarian stem cells, may be of later benefit. She was not deemed a suitable candidate for gonadotropin stimulation for oocyte preservation due to the undetectable anti-Müllerian hormone level. The pathologist described the macroscopic appearance of the ovary as “cystic and disrupted.” Microscopic histology of three right ovarian biopsies reported fibrovascular connective tissue with no primordial follicles in the ovarian cortex of sample one. Ovarian sample 2 reported a cystic follicle and a cystic corpus luteum but no primordial follicles within surrounding parenchyma. Ovarian sample 3 reported “fibrofatty connective tissue only. No ovarian parenchyma is identified.” Summary: “Levels through all tissue containing ovarian parenchyma show a single primordial follicle. No other follicular structures are identified.” No samples contained evidence of atypia or malignancy (Sullivan Nicolaides Pathology. Brisbane, Queensland, Australia). Personal communication with the reporting pathologist confirmed no lymphoid or granulomatous inflammation and suggested the ovarian appearance was “consistent with that of a woman in her late forties.”\nShe has been counseled about bone density preservation and the need for hormone replacement therapy. This case was notified to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) of Australia in January 2014 (reference number 333136) as diagnosed POI. Its listing as “amenorrhoea” on the TGA database in May 2014 was later altered to POF (July 2014).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Her examination found no signs of trauma and the blood pressure, heart and respiratory rate were normals. Her physical examination revealed a swollen and painful shoulder with warm shoulder pain. On palpation there was subcutaneous crepitation spreading to her arm, forearm and chest; the distal pulse was present, but there was no redness or necrotic areas. The joints of her shoulder and elbow were free and in a context of apyrexia, and in a well-preserved general condition. Her laboratory tests showed leukocytosis at 11,000 elements per mm3. Her sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein (CRP) level were normal. Plain radiographs (Figs. and ) of her shoulder showed the presence of a foreign body and subcutaneous gas in the soft tissues of the right scapular region, spreading to her arm and forearm.\nComputed tomography (CT) images (Fig. ) showed the presence of a right retro scapular para-median needle, measuring 10mm in length, and a diffuse parietal emphysema of her shoulder and right arm and her anterior chest wall and trunk, and beneath her right breast. Given the strong possibility of the diagnosis of gas gangrene, surgical debridement was performed.\nSurgical exploration found no foul odor in the subcutaneous tissue (which was normal) and muscle fascia. The opening of the exertional compartment showed slightly discolored stuffed muscles and gas bubbles, but without pus or necrotic areas. Bacteriological samples were taken and sent to the bacteriology laboratory for examination and tests. A course of triple-combination broad spectrum antibiotics was administered for 10 days. The results of the bacteriological sampling were sterile. She received post-operative sessions of hyperbaric oxygen therapy at the rate of one session of 45 minutes per day for 10 days, and daily care in the operating room. Her post-operative follow-up was very satisfactory, with resolution of her leukocytosis.\nThe quarrelsome and aggressive nature of our patient, her difficult relationship with the caregiver, records of her consultation for the same symptoms in four other hospitals, a lack of biological and clinical signs, and her inability to provide an explanation for the presence of the needle and the swelling in her right arm made us suspicions about the possibility of a factitious disease. Rigorous questioning had pushed our patient to admit that she had voluntarily introduced the needle, explaining the presence of a foreign body in the right shoulder.\nA psychiatric consultation was requested to confirm the diagnosis of a factitious disorder and treatment. Maltreatment history and emotional abuse during childhood were reported. Her psychiatric report stipulated that the act of self-injection of the needle and her need to draw attention to this was largely involuntary, whereas her trickery and simulation of a disease were involuntary and with no external gain or incentive therefore confirming munchausen syndrome.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She presented with severe lower back and bilateral leg pain. Her medical history was unremarkable except for a limited number of admissions for pain crisis, a positive sexual history, and a recent tattoo obtained two weeks prior to admission. Four days prior to presentation, she had undergone an elective erythrocytapheresis procedure in preparation for wisdom teeth extraction under general anesthesia. Her home medications included penicillin VK and regular intramuscular medroxyprogesterone acetate injections. Review of other systems was negative.\nInitial studies (complete blood count, urine pregnancy test, urinalysis, and lumbar spine radiographs) were within normal limits (including hemoglobin and hematocrit of 11.3 g/dL and 32.5%, resp.). The patient was admitted for intravenous fluids and opioid analgesics; yet her pain remained poorly controlled. The patient was given azithromycin and ceftriaxone for uncomplicated cervicitis suggested by pelvic exam. She subsequently became febrile to 39.2°C and developed increasing drowsiness.

The patient’s mother deceased from colon cancer secondary to FAP also suffered from Schizophrenia. Patient 1 was subsequently admitted to the psychiatric hospital as she demonstrated paranoid ideations, hyperreligiosity, expansive affect and internal preoccupation, worsening over a number of days prior to admission.\nThe patient was apparently well until 6 weeks prior to presentation when, over the course of a week, she demonstrated increasingly bizarre behavior. According to collateral history from an outside hospital, she stated she could only read from right to left on the page, like in Hebrew, and repeated “I am Jesus”, “Lord help me” multiple times. At that time, she was first hospitalized and stayed at an outside hospital for a 2-week period, where she was diagnosed with Schizophreniform disorder and was treated with Seroquel, an antipsychotic with mood stabilizing properties. However, after discharge, the patient only took one dose of the Seroquel before self-discontinuing due to the associated sedation she experienced. She did not attend her scheduled outpatient psychiatry intake appointment.\nThe patient was diagnosed with FAP at the age of 17, approximately 13 months prior to her first hospitalization, after genetic testing revealed a germline APC mutation R232X, resulting a premature truncation of the protein. Her mother, mother’s twin, and grandparent have also suffered from this familial colon cancer syndrome, as does her older brother. Her mother’s twin and older brother underwent prophylactic colectomy and patient 1 is currently being followed by the colorectal surgeon. The patient is likely to undergo colectomy in the next year, upon graduating from high school. The patient also has bilateral, subcentimeter thyroid nodules, which were identified on sonogram, and are being followed with an annual ultrasound exam.\nThe patient was born to a single mother, the second of three children, her older brother shares the same father and the younger brother has a different father. She moved from Jamaica to New York City at age 3. However, she lived in Canada with her mother’s cousin for a number of years during her mother’s battle with cancer, returning at the age of 13 or 14 to New York. The mother died from colon cancer when the patient was 15 and her aunt became her legal guardian. The patient’s older brother, age 23, living alone, also possesses the APC gene mutation and underwent prophylactic surgery a number of years ago. Her younger brother, age 14, is without the APC mutation, and is in foster care as he has behavior and temper issues. Patient 1’s maternal aunt and mother’s identical twin has undergone multiple surgeries but is currently alive. Her mother, her mother’s twin, and a grandparent reportedly suffered from mental illness, likely schizophrenia. Her mother had been hospitalized a number of times in a psychiatric facility.\nPregnancy, birth, neonatal, and childhood history were reportedly unremarkable, except for a mild speech delay, for which she received therapy at age 3. The patient is currently in 11th grade, with just under an 80 average and is planning to complete high school and graduate next year, within the usual 4 years. Peers at school have bullied her in the past, with name calling about her appearance the most common subject of the verbal abuse. The patient and her aunt both deny any use of alcohol or illicit substance in the past or presently.\nOn initial arrival to our unit, patient 1 was acutely psychotic. She appeared young looking, with normal muscle tone and coordination and although she made appropriate eye contact at times, she did appear internally preoccupied. She stated her mood was “okay” but her affect was labile, with inappropriate, excessive laughter during the encounter. Her speech was impoverished and she whispered at times. Her thought process was tangential, and the content was with religious preoccupation, ideas of influence, paranoid delusions, and thought broadcasting. She believed her aunt, was poisoning her and that she represented Satan. She stated the police were cockroaches, produced from her Aunt, and were out to get her. The patient also endorsed thought broadcasting, stating she could communicate, via thoughts, with Venus and “Blue moon” in space. She denied suicidal or homicidal ideations. She was oriented to self and place but not oriented to time or purpose. She was forgetful with impaired abstracting ability and impaired concentration. Her insight was poor, as she stated she did not need medication because “I am the medication,” and her judgment was deemed to be impaired. Due to the acute onset of her symptoms, known polyposis of the colon, and her first presentation in our care, a first-break psychosis workup was done. The MRI of the head was unremarkable, as were the chest X-ray, EKG, laboratory work and drug screen.\nPatient 1 was admitted to the adult inpatient psychiatric unit. She was started on Haloperidol, an antipsychotic, 2 mg twice daily by mouth, and promptly demonstrated a response. Her psychotic symptoms began to abate and she stopped reporting perceptual disturbances. Her thought process became more coherent and organized. Her attention and concentration improved. After demonstrating a slight tremor and sedation after 10 days of treatment, the dose was adjusted to 2 mg daily at bedtime and she was discharged on this dose. The psychological tests demonstrated her intelligence was within the normal range. After remaining in the hospital for 13 days, she was discharged home and was able to return to school. She continues to follow up in the outpatient setting with a psychiatrist.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient complained of pain and swelling, in the left maxillary anterior segment.\nOn clinical inspection a localized swelling in the gingiva of the left lateral incisor was evident and the tooth had a temporary filling. The maxillary left lateral incisor was not responsive to electronic pulp testing (Parkell Electronics. Division, Farmingdale, NY, USA) and pulp vitality tests with heat and cold. Patient reported discomfort on percussion as well as pain on palpation of periapical area. The tooth presented normal size and color and there was no sinus tract.\nThe periapical radiographic examination revealed an invaginated lateral incisor with 3 roots and a large periapical radiolucency (). According to the clinical and radiographic examination, the diagnosis was pulp necrosis with an abscess developed within an existing chronic apical periodontitis. Thus conventional root canal therapy was indicated. A cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan was indicated to observe the three-dimensional image of this complex anatomy. The CBCT image taken with Planmeca Promax 3D (Planmeca, Helsinki, Finland) device showed 3 roots: distal root with a C-shaped canal, mesial root with type III dens invagination and a middle root with a single canal ().\nThe tooth was anesthetized using buccal infiltration of 2% lidocaine containing 1:80000 epinephrine (Darupakhsh, Tehran, Iran) and then isolated. The temporary restoration was removed and the central canal was exposed. After mesiodistal extension of the coronal access, orifices of the two other canals was detected ().\nThe Ribbon-shaped orifice of the distal canal started at the palatal aspect of the tooth, and then swept around the distal side to end at the distobuccal angle. The invaginated mesial root canal was calcified and could be negotiated with #10 file (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) to the possible length. The central canal was wide, conical and straight, with pus drainage. After determination of working length (), all 3 canals were instrumented using the step-back technique and irrigated with 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) during the instrumentation. After biomechanical preparation of root canals, calcium hydroxide paste (Golchadent, Karaj, Iran) was mixed with saline and inserted into the canal; the access cavity was temporarily sealed with Cavit )Ariadent, Coltosol, Tehran, Iran).\nIn the next appointment after 14 days, the patient had no pain and swelling. After rubber dam isolation, calcium hydroxide was removed with master apical file and NaOCl irrigation. Working length of mesial canal was 5 mm and the canal was filled by mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA, Dr Lotfi, Tabriz, Iran). The C-shaped distal canal was filled with #35 gutta-percha (Ariadent, Tehran, Iran) using a lateral condensation technique and AH-26 (Dentsply, Tulsa Dental, Tulsa, OK, USA) root canal sealer. In the central canal which was wide and irregular in coronal and middle zones, the apical third was filled with lateral condensation of #30 gutta-percha and the middle and coronal regions were filled using injection-molded thermoplasticized gutta-percha (Beefill device, VDW, Munich, Germany) delivery system (). One week after completion of endodontic treatment, patient had no clinical symptom and the tooth was restored with composite resin (Gradia Direct, GC Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). After15 months of follow-up, the patient had no symptoms and the radiography showed healing of periapical lesion ().",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient was treated with β-blocker, calcium channel blocker, and angiotensin II receptor blocker, however, without satisfactory effect. The patient also complained of episodes of severe headache and palpitation during micturition, without history of lower urinary tract symptoms or hematuria. The physical examination and routine laboratory investigations were normal. The patient's height is 163 cm while the weight is 53 kg. On ultrasound abdomen 9.2 × 3.9 cm low echo-level lesion was seen in the retroperitoneum next to aorta in front of spine and 4.1 × 2.3 cm low echo-level lesion was seen in right posterior wall of the bladder. Computed tomography (CT) abdomen revealed 8.5 × 6.1 × 3.7 cm well capsulated lesion in portocaval region with increased enhancement in arterial phase and relative washout in portovenous phase. Part of portal vein, abdominal aorta, and renal artery were wrapped by the lesion (Figure A, B). A 3.5 × 2.1 × 1.3 cm similar enhancing lesion in right posterior bladder wall was present (Figure C). Twenty-four hour urinary norepinephrine was 465.45 μg/24 hour (normal: 16.69–40.65 μg/24 hour), urine epinephrine 26.76 μg/24 hour (normal: 1.74–6.42 μg/24 hour), while dopamine 124.5 μg/24 hour (normal: 20.93–330.59 μg/24 hour) within normal limits. Then, 131I-MIBG scintigraphy was performed which revealed high uptake only in both of the retroperitoneum and urinary bladder mass, but not in the adrenal glands or elsewhere (Figure A). Then, the diagnosis of concurrent PGL of the retroperitoneum and urinary bladder was made.\nAs the patient and her parents refused to be surgically excised, she was given the intermediate-dose 131I-MIBG therapy for the young patient without any basic diseases. 131I-MIBG therapy was approved by the Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent was also obtained before therapy. The patient received 6 doses of high-specific activity 131I-MIBG from October 2009 to April 2015, each treatment dose was 400 mCi. 131I-MIBG was administered as a slow intravenous infusion over a period of 1 hour. Thyroid uptake of free radioiodine was blocked either by potassium iodide 200 mg/day plus levothyroxine 100 μg/day for 72 hours prior to and 14 days after therapy. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored during 131I-MIBG infusion. Posttherapeutic 131I-MIBG imaging was performed 4 to 6 days after therapy. Toxicity was evaluated by extensive laboratory tests including complete blood count, liver function, and thyroid function tests. Twenty-four hour urinary catecholamines levels were measured 24 hours prior to and 7 days after each course therapy (Figure A–C). CT abdomen was used to assess the radiological tumor response within 3–6 months after the each dose of 131I-MIBG. The symptomatic, hormonal, and radiological tumor response, according to WHO criteria, assessed within 6 months after the each dose of 131I-MIBG. CR for symptomatic, hormonal, and radiographic tumor were defined as complete normalization for symptomatic response, catecholamine levels, and complete regression of radiological abnormalities and also a negative diagnostic 131I-MIBG scan. Partial response (PR) for symptomatic, hormonal, and radiographic tumor were defined as subjective decrease in intensity and frequency of symptoms, 50% or greater reduction from pretherapy level of hormones and 50% or greater reduction of all measurable tumor. After 4 course of 131I-MIBG therapy, the patient got symptomatic and hormonal CR. The lesion of urinary bladder was disappeared with CT (Figure E) and 131I-MIBG scan (Figure E), while the focus of retroperitoneum reduced more than 50% (PR) (CT scan: 2.3 × 1.8 × 1.3 cm) (Figure C, D). After 6 course intermediate-dose course of 131I-MIBG therapy, the patient got radiographic tumor CR (Figure G–I and Figure G). We monitor the myelosuppression and other toxicity closely by laboratory tests including complete blood count and liver function tests. The Supplemental Table 1, , contains complete blood count, liver function, and thyroid function tests before and after treatment.

One month prior to presentation, outpatient laboratory analysis revealed increased serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH). She did not have any other significant personal or family history.\nShe was admitted to our hospital in February 2010. On physical examination her height was 1.40 m and weight was 30 kg. Her vital signs were within normal limits. She presented with a marked cervical kyphosis.\nRelevant laboratory results showed hypercalcemia (13.36 mg/dL, normal 8.6–9.9 mg/dL), elevated PTH (2551 pg/mL, normal 12–88 pg/mL), elevated alkaline phosphatase level (4410 IU/L, normal 34–104 IU/L), hypercalciuria (urinary calcium of 213 mg/24 H, normal 100–250 mg/24 H), low creatinine clearance (25.84 mL/min/1.73 m2, normal ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2), and low 25[OH]D3 circulating level (13 ng/mL, normal 30–100 ng/mL). The laboratory findings at hospital admission and last follow-up visit are summarized in . Biochemical approach was further completed with prolactin 12.6 ng/mL, FSH 4.4 mIU/mL, LH 17 mIU/mL, estradiol 36.13 pg/mL, T3 1.78 nmol/L, T4 69.33 nmol/L, TSH 1.85 μUI/mL, thyroglobulin 5.7 ng/mL, ACTH 19 pg/mL, and morning cortisol 15.76 μg/dL, all within normal limits.\nSkeletal X-rays showed skull with “salt and pepper” lesions, vertebral compression fractures, brown tumors within the left humerus, and profuse calcifications within the pancreas and kidneys (). The patient did not refer to abdominal pain, nor any symptomatology related to endocrine and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. The electrocardiogram was unremarkable. Abdominal ultrasound revealed kidney stones causing bilateral dilation of the renal pelvis. Neck ultrasonography showed microcalcifications within a large echogenic mass, posterior to the right lobe of the thyroid gland of 33 × 14 × 14 mm, . A 25 mCi 99Tc-sestamibi scintigraphy reported persistence of the radionuclide material at 120 minutes in the right inferior parathyroid gland at the same location of the mass shown in the US, . Bone densitometry showed decreased Z-Score values (total lumbar Z-Score of −4.2), . Primary hyperparathyroidism secondary to a large parathyroid tumor was diagnosed.\nFor HBS prophylaxis, before surgery, she received a 400,000 IU of vitamin D2 (Drisdol) (ergocalciferol) and 1 mg of calcitriol. Right hemithyroidectomy with right lower parathyroidectomy was performed. A tumor of 2.8 cm with 3.8 g of weight was resected. Pathological revision reported a focal lesion containing parathyroid tissue; it infiltrated the nodule capsule, without trespassing it, and the diagnosis was consistent with an atypical parathyroid adenoma. Two lymph nodes demonstrated follicular hyperplasia. Despite the administration of vitamin D (50,000 per week) and calcitriol 0.75 mg per day after surgery, the 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels never reached a value above 30. 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D was not measured.\nPostsurgical laboratory analysis showed PTH values of 31.3 pg/mL, serum calcium of 8.5 mg/dL, phosphate of 1.9 mg/dL, and magnesium of 1.8 mg/dL; on physical examination she presented upper extremity distal contractures, oromandibular dystonia, Chvostek and Trousseau signs, and QTc interval prolongation. PTH levels reached up to 48.6 pg/mL after 1 month, coexisting with hypophosphatemia of 2.7 mg/dL. At last follow-up, PTH serum levels were between 80 and 90 pg/mL, . She developed a prolonged and severe HBS that required 3 months with oral and intravenous calcium supplementation. The calcium IV infusion was stopped three months later. High PTH levels with hypocalcemia but also hypophosphatemia ruled out hypoparathyroidism. “Protracted” HBS was therefore diagnosed. During her hospitalization she underwent two episodes of lithotripsy as treatment for the kidney stones. Serum calcium, phosphate, and magnesium levels during hospitalization and follow-up are shown in .\nAfter 42 months of treatment, bone densitometry scores improved within normal limits, . As an outpatient since 2010 she has been receiving an average of 1197 mg of oral elemental calcium, 1600 units of vitamin D, and 3 grams of magnesium sulfate per day. She was kept under close medical evaluation as an outpatient. Unfortunately in November 2013 the patient stopped coming to our institution with no clear reason, .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient had a preexisting idiopathic adolescent scoliosis.\nShe did not suffer from any neurological deficit.\nBecause of the instability and severe pain we decided to treat the patient surgically. We stabilized the thoracic spine from 3rd to 7th thoracic vertebra from posterior with pedicle screws and the sublaminar bands in the above described hybrid technique.\nSince the patient had very small thoracic pedicles (; 2.5 mm on the left side of the vertebra above the fractured one; on the right side the pedicles were blind, 1.6 mm in the vertebra below the fractured one), the only way to put the pedicle screws was parapedicular. The sublaminar bands were placed at the 3rd and 7th thoracic vertebra. Two rods were placed and fixed at the screws and the sublaminar clamps. A posterior fusion was added by using local bone graft together with demineralized bone matrix (DBM Pasty, Synthes, West Chester, USA) and tricalcium phosphate (chronOS, Synthes, West Chester, USA). No intraoperative complication occurred. The blood loss was 500 mL and the total operating time was 180 minutes.\nThe postoperative course was uneventful.

She had a chronic productive cough but no fever, weight loss, or hemoptysis. Chest X-ray revealed a residual right middle lobe infiltrate with no pleural effusion. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed patchy airspace opacities in the right lower lobe associated with bilateral lower lobe bronchiectatic changes. Interestingly, there were multiple structural abnormalities incidentally found in the form of an abdominal situs ambiguous with the liver seen in the midline, a right-sided stomach, and multiple small splenules in the right upper abdomen (). Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was positive for Haemophilus influenzae. All other differentials including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, fungal infections, and malignancy were ruled out.\nDuring that same period, the patient gave history of two new complaints: joint pain and swelling and amenorrhea. Regarding her joint complaints, the patient gave history typical of RA with symmetrical joint pain and swelling involving her small and large joints with early morning stiffness of more than an hour. On examination her tender joint count (TJC) was 10 and swollen joint count (SJC) was 7. She had a strongly positive Rheumatoid Factor of 350 and an anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (Anti-CCP) of 133. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were mildly elevated at 21 and 5.27 mg/L, respectively. The rest of her autoimmune panel including ANA and ENA profiles was negative. X-rays of the hands, elbows, shoulders, knees, and feet bilaterally revealed maintained joint spaces and no evidence of erosions. Based on these findings the patient was diagnosed to have RA. Her calculated DAS-28 score was 5.77, her Simple Disease Activity Index (SDAI) 32.5, and her Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) 32, all reflecting high disease activity. She was started on Methotrexate at a dose of 12.5 mg orally once weekly with supplemental folate. She was also kept on Prednisolone 10 mg orally daily with calcium and vitamin D.\nAs for her amenorrhea symptoms, the patient had irregular periods after menarche but became completely amenorrheic around 8 months prior to presentation. She had been married for one and a half years, had no children, and was not using any method of contraception. She was referred to Obstetrics and Gynecology Team for further evaluation and her work-up revealed the presence of a very high prolactin level of 4425 μg/L (normal range: 3–24 μg/L). another hormonal panel was within normal. She had no symptoms of galactorrhea, was not taking any new drugs, and had no history of renal, thyroid, or liver disease. She had no visual symptoms or headache or vomiting. Pelvic ultrasound showed a retroverted uterus with no abnormalities. She was given an appointment to do pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in addition to Endocrinology followup.\nDue to the earlier CT findings of situs ambiguous and history of chronic bronchiectasis, the diagnosis of KS was entertained. CT scan of the paranasal sinuses was therefore requested and it confirmed the presence of pansinusitis with complete opacification of the maxillary, sphenoid, and ethmoid sinuses (). Based on the presence of this triad, she was diagnosed with KS and was admitted for full work-up and treatment on the 20th of October 2014. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pituitary gland was done and it revealed a 2.2 × 2.1 × 1.2 cm intrasellar pituitary macroadenoma (). She was seen and evaluated by Endocrinology Team and started on Cabergoline 0.5 mg once weekly and discharged in a stable condition with outpatient followup.\nWhen the patient presented to Rheumatology Clinic the following month, she reported almost 80% improvement of her symptoms with significant reduction in her joint pain and complete resolution of morning stiffness and fatigue. Based on assessment that day, her DAS-28 score was 1.7 and her SDAI and CDAI scores were 4.9 and 3, respectively. Her prolactin level dropped to 293 μg/L. The patient achieved clinical remission and her Methotrexate dose was increased to 15 mg orally once weekly. She was instructed to taper down her steroids until tapering off. During the next visit three months later, she was still in remission with a DAS-28 score of 1.4, SDAI of 2.5, and CDAI of 2. Her Methotrexate dose was maximized to 20 mg once weekly. Repeated MRI of the pituitary gland revealed regression in the size of the macroadenoma to 1.4 × 1.4 cm with a further drop in her prolactin level to 28.9 μg/L. Cabergoline was increased to 1.5 mg orally twice a week on subsequent Endocrinology followup.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Visual acuity was (OD: 0.16) and (OS: Perception of light), examination revealed marked relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) in the left eye, cycloplegic refraction was OD: +8.00(−1.50X70) and OS: +10.50(−1.25X15), Axial length measurements were: OD: 18.80 mm and OS: 19.10 mm. Cornea and anterior segment examination was within normal limits and dilated fundus examination revealed:\nOD: abnormal foveal reflex (Fig. a), peripheral nummular pigmentations in the superior attached retina (Fig. b) and infero-temporal exudative retinal detachment not threatening the macula, with severe telangiectasia and very dense hard exudates all over the inferior detached retina. Fluorescein angiography (FA) (Fig. c, d) revealed areas of capillary non-perfusion with diffuse capillary and focal leakage in the areas of abnormal vessels with extensive leakage in late phases.\nOS: mildly elevated subtotal exudative retinal detachment with extensive hard exudates and telangiectatic vessels all over the detached retina, with the same pigmented patches noted in the right eye (Fig. a, b). FA revealed extensive leakage beginning from the early phases and continuing during the whole study time (Fig. c, d).\nERG revealed severely reduced scotopic and photopic responses; suggestive of a severe form of rod-cone dystrophy consistent with LCA. Ocular coherence tomography (OCT) revealed serous retinal detachment involving the fovea in left eye.\nExamination of family members revealed two younger male siblings (12 years old, and 2 years old) having profound visual loss. The clinical presentation of the two siblings is presented in Table , and it was suggestive of LCA, one more sibling (8 years old male) and the two parents revealed no ocular abnormalities.\nCRB1 mutation was suspected to be responsible for the pathologic presentations of the patients, and gene sequencing was performed searching for mutations in the entire coding sequence of the CRB1 gene using fluorescent sequencing, which revealed that the three siblings share the same variant c.2555T >C (p.I852T) in the homozygous state. Accordingly, diagnosis of LCA8 was confirmed in the three siblings.\nAs there are no definitive guidelines for the management of coat’s like vasculopathy associated with retinal dystrophies, decision was made to perform pan-retinal photocoagulation (PRP) over the inferior detached retina in the left eye with close follow up, and only close follow up in the right eye as the parents refused any type of management in the better seeing eye. The retinal detachment remained stable over the following 6 weeks. On the eighth week post laser the patient complained of sudden decrease of visual acuity in her better right untreated eye to perception of light (PL) with no right projection, and to no perception of light (NPL) in the left previously treated eye. The decision to perform pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for the right eye was made, advantages and disadvantages of surgical treatment were explained to the patient and parents and informed consent was taken. Standard PPV with extensive intraoperative PRP was done with the use of silicone oil tamponade at the end of surgery. No surgical treatment was done for the left eye as the patient refused surgery for this eye.\nOver 6 months follow up period, the retina of the right eye remained attached with no improvement in visual acuity (perception of light with no light projection), while the left eye continued to have subtotal retinal detachment, which appeared to increase in height and finally developed neovascular glaucoma.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On examination, she was globally hypermobile and had painful and reproducible snapping of the right ITB over the greater trochanter.\nX-ray revealed normal femoroacetabular morphology, while magnetic resonance imaging showed thickening of the posterior one-third of the ITB. There was no evidence of intra-articular pathology.\nAfter discussion of available treatment options, the patient elected to undergo index endoscopic Z-lengthening of the IT band. One year into an uncomplicated recovery, the patient began to experience painful recurrent snapping. A revision endoscopic ITB lengthening was conducted by creating a diamond-shaped window in the ITB. Unfortunately, the patient presented with recurrent symptoms after 5 months of initial relief and, at this time, open Z-lengthening of the GMax insertion was performed with direct open examination of the ITB and gluteal complex. After 18 months of pain-free function, the patient again experienced symptomatic recurrence. A more aggressive open tenodesis of the IT band and GMax release were proposed.\nFor this novel procedure, the IT band was divided longitudinally and the GMax insertion was released. A trochantoplasty of posterosuperior facet was performed after examination revealed abrasion against the ITB. Suture anchors were placed proximal to the GMax insertion on the posterior border of the linea aspera and proximal femur (4.5 mm PEEK Corkscrew and 3.0 mm BioComposite SutureTak, Arthrex Inc, Naples, FL). The posterior division of the ITB and GMax was then secured using these anchors. The anterior fibers of the IT band were sutured to the anterior vastus lateralis and greater trochanter, as seen in .

Both panoramic radiograph () and computed tomography (CT) with solid prototype () revealed two well-defined markedly radiopaque/radiodense lesions arising on the ramus (27 × 19 mm) and the mandible angle (23 × 15 mm). These lesions were very suggestive of osteomas and GS was hypothesised according to anamnesis and mandible lesions. A colonoscopy showed colonic and rectal polyposis.

Her neurological examination and medical history was otherwise not contributory. The presenting brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is shown below in Figure .\nAbnormal laboratory values included an elevated prolactin level and decreased free T4, B-HCG, FSH, ACTH, LH, and AM cortisol.\nA combined neurosurgery and otolaryngology approach with neuronavigation was utilized. A lumbar drain was placed for CSF diversion. Using a rigid 0-degree endoscope for visualization, a nasoseptal flap was harvested. Bilateral posterior ethmoidectomies and septostomy were performed, followed by a wide opening of the sphenoid sinus from the clivus to planum sphenoidale. The bony septum was flattened with a high-speed drill and the medial opticocarotid recesses were identified bilaterally. A craniectomy was performed encompassing the floor of the sella and the anterior portion of the planum sphenoidale, just posterior to the cribriform plate. The sella and planum dura were opened, as was the medial opticocarotid recesses bilaterally to gain lateral access to the suprasellar tumor. Horizontal incisions were made in the dura above and below the superior intracavernous sinus. The dura was reflected in a cruciate fashion and the pituitary gland was noted adjacent to the optic chiasm due to its superior displacement by the tumor. The optic chiasm was then identified superiorly; the tumor and its capsule were resected sequentially and sharply dissected off the optic chiasm, using rigid 0-degree and 30-degree endoscopes for visualization. The closure/skullbase reconstruction was performed using non-suturable dural allograft inlay, a nasoseptal flap, and a dural sealant (DuraSeal® Covidien, Dublin, Ireland).\nThe postoperative brain MRI is shown below in Figure .\nIntermittent lumbar drainage was utilized for four days and the lumbar drain was discontinued after a clamp trial.

Her medical history included arterial hypertension for one year with no history of traumatic injury or Takayasu's arteritis. On physical examination, height was 150 cm and weight was 40 kg, pulse rate was 89 bpm with blood pressure of 162/95 mmHg in both arms, and all pulses were palpable. However, lower extremity pulses were diminished with a typical radial-to-femoral delay and systolic pressure difference between brachial and ankle was 80 mmHg. Routine blood tests and urine analysis were normal. A grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur could be heard along the left intercostal area and severe S1 sound was audible. The examination of the respiratory and other systems was normal. Transthoracic echocardiography examination showed increased wall thickness of left ventricle (interventricular septum 1.3 cm and posterior wall 1.3 cm), normal left ventricular ejection fraction (65%), and increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure (45 mmHg). Aortic valve was bicuspid and normal functioning. The maximum peak flow velocity in the left ventricular outflow tract measured 1.6 m/s (corresponding to maximal gradient of 10.3 mmHg), indicating no significant left ventricular outflow tract gradient. An increased peak flow velocity of 3.8 m/s (corresponding to a maximal gradient of 58 mmHg) together with the typical color Doppler pattern indicated severe stenosis of the descending aorta (Figures and ). The parasternal short-axis views revealed a PDA () and pulmonary to systemic flow ratio (Qp/Qs) was calculated as 1.8. Thorax computed tomography (CT) angiography showed that diameter of aorta at the preductal level is 20 mm, 11 mm at coarcted segment, and 23 mm at the postductal level. Also the diagnosis of PDA was confirmed with thorax CT angiography ().\nPercutaneous treatment of the CoA and PDA with a generally preferred balloon expandable covered stent was planned. But balloon expandable covered stents dedicated for CoA were not available at those days. For this reason, we decided to use a self-expandable thoracic stent graft. Because of their small size detected on CT angiography, common femoral arteries (3.0 mm, both) and external iliac arteries (4.0 mm, both) were not suitable for thoracic stent graft implantation. So we decided to use left common iliac artery (CIA) via RP approach which was 5.5 mm in diameter (right CIA was 5.3 mm). The procedure was performed under general anesthesia. A 6-F pigtail catheter was placed via right femoral artery to the descending aorta, but the catheter could not pass the coarcted segment (). The coarcted segment could be crossed using 0.035-inch hydrophilic guide wire (Radifocus, Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and 5-F multipurpose diagnostic catheter (Cordis Corporation, Miami, Florida, USA). This catheter was changed with a 5-F marker pigtail catheter (Cook Inc., Bloomington, USA). Gradient across coarcted segment was measured as 85 mmHg. For retroperitoneal approach of left CIA, an incision was made in the skin of left lower quadrant of abdomen about 3 cm above from the inguinal ligament. Then, left CIA was reached and a 6-F introducer sheath was placed by Seldinger technique. Coarcted segment was passed with hydrophilic guidewire and 5-F multipurpose catheter via the sheath in left CIA. Hydrophilic guidewire was changed with extra stiff Amplatz guidewire (Amplatz Extra Stiff 0.035 inches, Boston Scientific, MA, USA). The sheath in left CIA was exchanged with a 22 Fr E-asy Plus hemostatic valved introducer sheath (Jotec GmbH, Hechingen, Germany). A 26 mm × 100 mm sized thoracic stent graft (Ankura, Lifetech Scientific Ltd., Shenzhen, China) was placed over the coarcted segment via the 22 Fr sheath (). After confirmation of optimal position, the stent was released and then dilated with a balloon catheter (E-xpand, Jotec GmbH, Hechingen, Germany) with high atmosphere for optimal dilatation of the stenosed segment to exclude residual gradient and complete apposition of the stent (). Control aortography confirmed that the coarcted segment is optimally dilated and the PDA is completely covered by stent graft without any leak. The measured gradient across coarcted segment after stent placement was 5 mmHg. Similar findings were confirmed by echocardiographic assessment. Also intravascular pressure difference between ascending aorta and femoral artery was 5 mmHg. The patient recovered well and was discharged three days after the procedure. Before discharge, control CT angiography showed fully expanded thoracic stent graft with complete exclusion of PDA (). The patient was asymptomatic after two years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She was originally diagnosed by the Oxford Oncology team with metastatic alveolar RMS 22 months earlier, with the primary in the right flexor digitorum brevis, with extensive metastatic disease, including intramuscular deposit to the calf, popliteal fossa nodes, external inguinal chain, multiple mediastinal nodes and bilateral lung parenchymal involvement with pleural effusion. Systemic chemotherapy (ifosfamide, vincristine, actinomycin and doxorubicin) with surgical resection of the right foot lesion, followed by maintenance chemotherapy achieved prolonged disease control.\nFourteen months after diagnosis of the metastatic RMS she noticed a change in the left iris colour. Examination done at the Oxford Eye Hospital indicated an iris mass (Fig. ), and on PET scan, extensive systemic relapse was detected, including uptake of the primary foot site, pulmonary nodules as well as the left iris. Vincristine, irinotecan and temozolomide (VIT) were started, to control the recurrent disease, including the iris metastasis, which showed good response (Fig. ). A subsequent on – treatment relapse occurred after 6 cycles of VIT (primary site, lungs and musculoskeletal).

On admission, her blood pressure was 107/69 mm Hg with a heart rate of 104/min and a temperature of 36.7°C. Abdominal findings did not reveal focal tenderness or guarding. There was no jaundice. Her initial chemistry panel revealed a serum potassium level of 2.3 mmol/L, a serum bicarbonate level of 32 mmol/L, and a serum magnesium level of 0.45 mmol/L. Nausea and vomiting were controlled by ondansetron and promethazine, but the electrolyte abnormalities persisted and remained critically low in spite of the resolution of hyperemesis. Initial treatment consisted of intravenous isotonic saline and parenteral potassium and magnesium supplementation. After a total of 380 mmol of potassium and 16 grams of magnesium have been given intravenously, potassium and magnesium levels did not rise past 2.8 mmol/L and 0.45 mmol/L, respectively.\nSerum chemistries and spot urine electrolytes performed on day 7 of hospitalization showed the findings outlined in . The arterial pH of 7.51 and pCO2 of 41 mm Hg at a time the serum bicarbonate level was 32 mmol/L defined a primary metabolic alkalosis. While the patient was receiving intravenous isotonic saline, the plasma renin activity measured 50 μg/L/hr and serum aldosterone level 2.09 nmol/L, the combination indicating a state of secondary hyperaldosteronism. The failure of saline infusion to suppress renin secretion after cessation of gastrointestinal fluid losses and at appropriate blood pressure for her age and state of pregnancy pointed to the need to identify a separate basis for renin-stimulated hyperaldosteronism. The absence of hypertension discounted consideration of a primary renin secreting tumor or of renin stimulation from a renovascular disease such as fibromuscular dysplasia.\nThe presence of severe hypokalemia with a serum potassium level of 2.6 mmol/L and an inappropriate elevation of the transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG; see ) gave evidence of an ongoing and pathological effect of the elevated aldosterone levels to cause continued loss of potassium in the urine. The urine sodium greater than 100 mmol/L on two occasions could represent the effect of ongoing saline infusion and achievement of adequate extracellular volume expansion or of inappropriate sodium loss via a renal tubular defect in sodium reabsorption and conservation. The simultaneous hypomagnesemia made consideration of the latter explanation of a tubulopathy more likely and fit with the clinical characteristics of GS.\nTreatment was begun with amiloride started at 5 mg/day and increased to 10 mg/day while continuing oral potassium and magnesium supplementation of 150 mmol/day and 4000 mg/day, respectively. On this regimen, levels of both electrolytes rose with a serum potassium of 3.3 mmol/L and serum magnesium 0.74 mmol/L at discharge from the hospital (day 15 of hospitalization).\nThis patient had several readmissions for recurrence of the nausea and vomiting during her first trimester of pregnancy, each associated with profound hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, and management continued according to the plan outlined earlier. Apart from the nausea and emesis, she was relatively asymptomatic and denied muscle cramping, weakness, palpitations, or syncope.

Patient stated that her symptoms were worse in the morning and relieved only by smoking marijuana, which she had been increasingly doing for the past two years. Her emesis was consistently nonbloody and nonbilious. The frequency of her symptoms had been progressing over the previous few months, and at the time of presentation, she was having persistent nausea and vomiting throughout the day. She reported using cannabis 2-3 times per day on average.\nThe initial physical exam was unremarkable and her vital signs were within normal limits. She had a normal BMI and appeared nondistressed and nonanxious. Her heart was of regular rate and rhythm without appreciable murmurs. Her lungs were clear to auscultation. Her abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, and without appreciable organomegaly.

Interestingly, she did not have slowed gastric emptying, which is frequently associated with cannabis use in CVS [], and we were unable to find any studies regarding the prevalence of delayed gastric emptying in CHS. The patient's lack of symptom relief from multiple antiemetics prompted a review of the literature, which revealed prior case reports of resolution of CHS symptoms using haloperidol in the emergency department setting []. Although the patient was unwilling to discontinue cannabis, she agreed to initiate a trial of haloperidol 5 mg daily for symptom relief. At the next visit, the patient reported complete resolution of the previously refractory nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain within one day of starting treatment.

Mild discomfort was felt whenever the swelling was more intense. A well-defined, soft lesion in the left upper eyelid could be palpated, just below the superior orbital rim, without associated inflammatory signs. No decrease in visual acuity or alterations of extraocular movements was found. Intraocular pressure was 17 mmHg OD and 20 mmHg OS. Computed tomography disclosed a distinct homogeneous lesion in the left superior orbit, molding to the globe and other orbital structures (Fig. ). There was no bone erosion. The findings favored the diagnosis of a lymphoid lesion and a transpalpebral biopsy was indicated and performed.\nHistopathological evaluation revealed the presence of structures resembling lymphoid follicles surrounded by loose connective tissue (Fig. ). At higher magnification, those structures were composed of numerous blood vessels lined by plump endothelial cells with oval nuclei protruding into the lumen (Fig. ). Surrounding the vessels, there was a chronic inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells and a large proportion of eosinophils. Immunohistochemical studies, performed on paraffin-embedded tissue, showed the following: Factor VIII underscored the marked vascularity of the lesion (Fig. ), highlighting atypical vascular lining with ""epithelioid"" or ""histiocytoid"" cells (Fig. ).

The patient had no history of trauma and denied any recent history of fevers and chills. Pain was insidious in onset and gradually worsened causing difficulty in walking. Pain had increased markedly during the two months prior to presentation to our clinic. The patient had a liver abscess at the age of 4 and past open heart surgery for total correction of tetralogy of fallot at the age of 7 years. On examination the patient had tenderness and a swelling on the outer aspect of the right foot in the calcanocuboid region. There was no soft tissue involvement even though the overlying skin was warm. No appreciable lymphadenopathy was noted. She could not bear weight on the right foot. Motor function was difficult to asses due to excruciating pain on movement; she would drag her foot on the ground while walking suggesting that dorsiflexion was severely affected.\nConventional radiographs showed a lytic lucent area within the right cuboid bone (Figure &). Septations were seen, but the cortex was intact. No fractures or dislocation of the cuboid was noted.\nMRI showed cystic areas with fluid filled levels in the right cuboid bone (Figure ). Mild expansion of the bone was noted. However no cortical break or involvement of other tarsal bones was seen. The lesion appeared hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2 images and also showed post contrast enhancement. Based on the imaging studies the foremost differential diagnosis of giant cell tumor, chondroblastoma, and aneurysmal bone cyst were made.\nAn open biopsy was thereafter performed. Microscopic examination of the tissue revealed sheets of cells exhibiting oval to elongated nuclei and moderate eosinophilic cytoplasm with distinct highlighted cell boundaries. Cells were indented with lobulated nuclei (Figure ). Occasional mitotic figures and scattered giant cells were also identified. Focal areas of fine calcification around individual cells (called chicken wire calcification) were seen (Figure ). Tumor cells were positive for glycogen on PAS stain. Cells were set in chondroid matrix which was highlighted with PAS stain (Figure ). In some areas cystic spaces containing hemorrhage along with multinucleated giant cells in the wall were also seen. A diagnosis of chondroblastoma associated with an aneurysmal bone cyst was made.\nAn intralesional curettage using a high speed burr was then performed. The defect was then filled in by cancellous bone graft and bone substitutes.\nAt 6 months post-operatively the patient was ambulating normally without a limp. Range of motion at the ankle, subtalar, and midtarsal joints had improved significantly. The patient will be followed with serial radiographs at 3-months for 1 year.

NiCOLe BrAY,18,F,O+,Hypertension,15-08-2021,Jasmine Terrell,Irwin-Vaughn,Medicare,25073.14841,186,Elective,14-09-2021,Ibuprofen,Inconclusive,"An 18-year-old athletically active female university student presented to the Murdoch University Chiropractic Clinic complaining of bilateral upper trapezius pain. She commented that she thinks she is ""double jointed"" because her shoulder ""pops in and out of joint"". The patient stated that she had had this shoulder dysfunction as long as she could remember. It had never caused her pain or limited her activities of daily living (ADL's), including rowing and playing stringed instruments; however she would prefer to not have the dysfunction. She denied any shoulder trauma or knowledge of any personal or family history of connective tissue disorders. Relevant medical history included a 20°C scoliotic curve at 11-years-of-age which progressed to 30°C in six months; after being braced for 1.5 years the curve decreased to 24°C and stabilised.\nThe patient did not exhibit antalgia, and there was no obvious deformity of the left shoulder apparent upon static observation. Appearance and temperature of the skin about the neck, shoulders, and thoracic region were unremarkable, but generalised muscle tone and bulk at the left shoulder were subjectively decreased when compared to the right. Active range of motion (AROM) and passive range of motion (PROM) of both shoulders were full and pain-free in all directions. However, it was noted that the patient's left shoulder appeared to subluxate (or dislocate) and relocate from the glenoid fossa regularly between 75°C and 180°C of abduction. This dislocation/relocation pattern also appeared to occur to a lesser degree during flexion of the left shoulder. Manual muscle testing of the shoulder musculature revealed a mild weakness of the left supraspinatus (4/5). The neurological examination was unremarkable. Impingement tests were negative for pain, but excessive internal rotation of the left shoulder was demonstrated during Hawkins-Kennedy test [] when compared to the right. Anterior instability tests were also pain-free, but positive for laxity on the left. A chiropractic examination did not reveal any suggestion of manipulable lesions in the shoulder complex.\nObservation of scapulohumeral rhythm revealed early lateral rotation of the left scapula, possibly due to chronic aberrant motor patterns including an early facilitation of the trapezius musculature and delayed serratus anterior and lower trapezius muscles. As a result, the normally smooth arc of shoulder abduction between 75°C and 180°C was punctuated by sharp, clunking, jerking movements which appeared to be due to the humerus repeatedly slipping from the glenoid fossa (see Additional file ). The patient was instructed to co-contract her shoulder during abduction. This involved training the patient to contract the pectoralis minor, serratus anterior, subscapularis, latissimus dorsi and lower trapezius muscles. This complicated manoeuvre was facilitated by the clinician lightly pinching the posterior axilla muscle groups (latissimus dorsi and lower trapezius) by placing her fingers in the axilla from behind and having her thumb on the posterior aspect of the lower trapezius muscle, and then asking the patient to ""contract these muscles"". While co-contracting this muscle group and instructing the patient to perform the abduction movement, it was noted that the aberrant glenohumeral rhythm did not occur until the end range of the movement. There were also fewer episodes of glenohumeral clunking, allowing the patient to achieve a smoother arc of movement (see Additional file . Note: the patient performs abduction on the right demonstrating a normal movement pattern. She then performs an abduction manoeuvre on the left; first without co-contraction, then a second time with co-contraction).\nRadiological investigation was ordered to rule out an anatomical aetiology (such as shoulder joint dysplasia) and confirm or deny an aberrant motor pattern as the sole cause of dysfunction. This consisted of plain film radiography and video fluoroscopy. A left shoulder series consisting of AP internal rotation, AP external rotation, and AP weighted (3 kg) neutral views (all taken in Grashey position []) revealed no bony dysplasia (Figures , , ). Video fluoroscopy consisting of AP and axial projections confirmed the suspicion that the humerus subluxated inferiorly at the glenohumeral joint as it moved through the abduction arc. The axial projection showed a significant posterior component to this subluxation. A follow-up projection AP projection with co-contraction of the shoulder showed that these newly combined motor patterns kept the glenohumeral joint stable, making the arc of motion smoother, and reducing the dynamic subluxation. When viewing the following videos note the significant dysrhythmia for 4 repetitions followed by a smoother rhythm from the patient's conscious facilitation of co-contraction (see Additional file ).\nChronic, severe, non-traumatic, multidirectional instability of the left glenohumeral joint secondary to ligamentous laxity. This was accompanied by glenohumeral kinesio-pathology and aberrant scapulohumeral rhythm due to suboptimal motor patterns.\nWe opine that this unusual presentation was associated with facilitation of the upper trapezius with suspected inhibition of the subscapularis, lower trapezius, latissimus dorsi, serratus anterior and possibly the remaining rotator cuff. Without further EMG studies, this is simply the author's clinical opinion.\nGiven the unusual presentation of this case, choice of therapy was problematic. The patient expressed a disinterest in surgery to correct the potential capsular laxity. Considering the lack of pain and the chronicity of the dysfunction, a conservative approach was recommended to the patient.\nThe goals of treatment were to decrease the dysfunction in her shoulder movement by improving the development of optimum motor patterns and improving muscular balance of the shoulder girdle.\nMonfils, et al [] state that ""motor skill acquisition occurs through modification and organization of muscle synergies into effective movement sequences"".\nBecause of the documented importance of muscle synergy and the progressions of motor control and stabilizer function [] we decided to employ the General Functional Assessment Pyramid (Figure ).\nThe patient was seen fortnightly for several weeks and was reassessed at every visit. The patient's initial trapezius complaint resolved within the third treatment. The single most important outcome measure utilised was the degree of shoulder abduction (performed while co-contracting the shoulder) obtained before dysfunction (subluxation-relocation) resulted.\nDegree of left shoulder abduction before subluxation-relocation results are detailed in Table .\nAt six weeks it was also observed that the patient could abduct her left shoulder to 105°C without conscious contraction of the glenohumeral and scapular stabilisers before dysfunction resulted. That was an improvement from the baseline of 75°C.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The neonate adapted well to extra-uterine life as evidenced by Apgar scores of eight and nine at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The pregnancy had been uneventful, and the maternal screens were all negative. There was no evidence of diabetes or pre-eclampsia during pregnancy. The neonate was transferred to the newborn nursery for routine newborn care. Physical examination in the newborn nursery revealed a palpable mass in the right lumbar area. Significant laboratory findings in the neonate included hematuria, and an elevated serum creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dl prompting transfer to the neonatal intensive care unit. A renal ultrasound evaluation showed an enlarged right kidney (5.56 cm) with loss of corticomedullary distinction. A renal Doppler flow study demonstrated an increased resistive index of the right renal artery with suboptimal wave forms of the right renal vein and a clot in the right renal vein (Figure ). A Doppler flow study of the left renal artery and vein was normal. The neonate had normal blood pressures throughout the hospital stay.\nThe neonate and her parents were evaluated for prothrombotic risk factors. The mother's laboratory parameters were remarkable for an elevated level of Lp (a) of 73 mg/dl (normal 0 to 40 mg/dl), and fibrinogen of 512 mg/dl (156 to 400 mg/dl). The plasma Lp (a) concentration was measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique using mouse monoclonal anti-apo (a) capture antibody and sheep polyclonal anti-apoB detection antibody (COALIZA Lp (a), Chromogenix). The other laboratory tests on the mother were normal: plasma homocysteine 5.3 μmol/l; protein C activity greater than 125%; protein S activity greater than 125%; anticardiolipin antibody IgG 6.2 IgG phospholipid binding units; anticardiolipin IgM 6.4 IgM phospholipid binding units; beta 2 glycoprotein IgG less than 9 standard IgG antibeta 2 glycoprotein units; beta 2 glycoprotein IGM less than 9 standard IgM antibeta 2 glycoprotein units; lupus anticoagulant negative; Factor VIII A assay 108%; antinuclear antibody (ANA) screening negative; antithrombin III 94%; prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), international normalized ratio (INR) normal. DNA analysis showed no point mutation (G20210A) in the 3' untranslated region of the prothrombin gene, no genetic polymorphism (Arg 506/Glu 506) for Factor V Leiden, and no gene mutation (C677T) for 5' 10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). The paternal screens were all normal.\nThe plasma Lp (a) level in the neonate was 11 mg/dl (0 to 40 mg/dl). This was measured when the maternal Lp (a) results became available, that is, 4 days after the diagnosis of RVT. The plasma homocysteine level was 4.6 μmol/l (4 to 13.7 μmol/l). A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head of the neonate was negative for saggital sinus thrombosis. The neonate was started on low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) at 1.5 mg/kg/day every 12 hours, with antifactor Xa monitoring. The antifactor Xa activity measured was 0.74 IU/ml (less than 0.10 IU/ml). The serum creatinine level decreased to 0.5 mg/dl 9 days after initiation of treatment, and urinalysis showed no evidence of hematuria. Renal ultrasound Doppler flow studies were repeated at weekly intervals during the hospital stay. One week after initiation of treatment, an ultrasound demonstrated persistence of RVT and development of a new thrombosis in the inferior vena cava. The neonate was discharged home on enoxaparin and followed by a hematologist, a nephrologist and a primary care physician. A follow-up ultrasound Doppler flow study at 2 months of age showed a normal flow pattern in the aorta, inferior vena cava, right and left renal arteries and veins indicating resolution of the thrombosis (Fig. ). Enoxaparin was discontinued at 2 months of age. The baby continued to do well with no evidence of residual renal dysfunction or hypertension at 18 months of age.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abnormal laboratory findings included a white blood cell count of 4.9 × 109/L (3% atypical lymphocytes) with large granular cells and anisocytosy in peripheral smear.\nLiver dysfunction was seen, with an increase in the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (1515 IU/l), alanine aminotransferase (1658 IU/l), lactate dehydrogenase (1080 IU/l) and total bilirubin (18.6 mg/dl). Prothrombin time was 28%. Serum immunoglobulin levels were elevated (3.8 gr/dl) with a titre of anti nucleus antibody (ANA) of 1:640. No antibodies against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) were detected. However anti-HHV-6 antibody (IgG and IgM) were detected with IgM index of 3.2 (cut off for positive control > 1.1). A diagnosis of hepatic failure was made, and liver biopsy was performed during the acute stage. Histologic examination showed moderate infiltration of atypical lymphoid cells and diffuse focal vacuolar degeneration of hepatocytes. The infiltrating lymphocytes were positive for CD3, CD4, and CD8, but negative for CD20. The presence of HHV-6 DNA was shown in liver tissue by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a viral load of 280 genomes/106 of cellular genomes, suggesting active viral replication in the hepatocytes.

She reported a number of triggers for her anger, but that these triggers would always relate in some way to events from her past that she remained very angry about. In essence, the presenting event combined with her past life events led to her anger rising to the point where she would cut to relieve herself of this distress.\nDuring the initial assessment Natalie reported an uneventful childhood in relation to her emotional and physical health, her school life or family life.

She reported an episode of an upper respiratory tract infection 3 weeks prior to the onset of her neurological symptoms. Past, personal and social history was unremarkable. Clinical examination revealed decreased muscle strength in all extremities associated with hypotonia and areflexia.\nA diagnosis of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) was considered and a lumbar puncture was performed. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed albuminocytologic dissociation (elevated protein with normal white blood cell count in CSF) suggestive of GBS. She was started on intravenous immunoglobulin G, but within 48 hours, she progressed to complete flaccid quadriparesis with involvement of respiratory muscles and required mechanical ventilatory support.\nOn day 12, a cardiac electrophysiology consultation was requested for bradycardia and multiple episodes of asystole. These episodes occurred spontaneously, unrelated to tracheobronchial suctioning, blood drawing or any other intervention. The longest observed pause was 12 seconds. Electrolyte profile was normal and oxygenation was satisfactory. The result of her 12-lead ECG is shown in Figure .\nIn view of the multiple episodes of bradycardia and asystole the decision was made to insert a pacemaker. The patient initially received a temporary pacemaker. However, due to an anticipated prolonged clinical course and the potential for recurrent bradycardia and asystole, an INSIGNIA Ultra DR dual chamber permanent pacemaker was implanted after 5 days. The pacemaker was initially programmed to VVI mode at 40 beats per minute to prevent pacing as much as possible. The pacemaker mode was switched to DDDR at the time of discharge because of lack of spontaneous sinus node activity. A paced rhythm was present 18 days post implant, suggesting occurrence of intermittent bradycardia.\nThe patient returned to our office for a routine pacemaker check 3 months after implantation. The pacemaker check revealed that she was in paced rhythm for most of the time in this period. Seventy percent was atrial paced ventricular sensed rhythm with a set lower rate of 40 beats per min. Twenty percent was atrial paced ventricular paced rhythm with a set AV delay of 220 msec. Only for ten percent of the time was she in atrial sensed ventricular sensed rhythm. This may indicate prolonged influence on the autonomic tone even after complete somatic recovery and likely justifies the need for a permanent pacemaker. As far as choice of pacemaker mode is concerned, our patient received a DDDR mode.
